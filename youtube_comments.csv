this reminds me of my favorite movie max but with an unimaginable twist towards the so basically the older brother who was in the army died while trying to save his dog max from an explosion and he didnt make it out alive and so basically in the end the other brother ended up saving the world from crime and max helps to and some of his friends and the older brothers best friend was actually fake and the mom was very depressed after the passing of the older brother kyle and so basically i imagined that a miracle happened and after the funeral kyle came back to life and that is what the phone call about and so instead of coming home immediately kyle descided to surprise his family at the once agian in my imagination other brother justins award ceremony for saving and helping max laurengraham,positive

ive watched this over and overgreat acting from the handsome fire chief,positive
this makes me cry lol,positive
nope be in this cheff shoes amazing even if is movie,positive

being able to leave kids at fire stations was a good idea an while this is a tv show im sure this must have happened in real life,positive
this is the kind of man i hope most men strive to become,positive
tears of joy running down my cheeks,positive
look at yall crying over a tv show im not,positive
weve had a good string of strong black fatherleader figures in tv lately boden holt etc,positive
what a real man is on and off the screen he does a great job in this role because it is an extension of himself in real life,positive
they way they put the camera on the female paramedic i wonder if it was she knew who the baby belong to or if it was hers just a thought very touching scene,positive
im not sure why but i watch this video nearly everyday chief boden his acting was amazing x,positive
what a great actor he is,positive
i thought this guy was an african dictator,positive
this ones important chief,positive
no thank youcharlottebecause you have made this chiefa very happy man today,positive
notice he couldnt stop looking at her,positive
the female firefighter and the other male watching her were they the parents just their reactions say yes,positive
om namah shivaya om parvati mata namah,positive

my favorite w episode of all time,positive
cry me a river,positive
the transformation on his faceamazing performance,positive
is it just me but this female firefighter kinda looks not very happy about this i havent watched the entire episode so im completely ignorant about what happens but her entire vibe feels like shes her biological mother ish kinda and shes having mixed feelings seeing her daughter again again i know i could be wrong but thats just the way she looks,positive
this reminds me of clementine imagining lee on the train,positive
what episode and series is this,positive
i could watch this scene a hundred times and still get teary eyes,positive
first time i saw this when she said do you recognize me i thought she was gonna drop im your daughter bomb,positive
why does gabi have such a weird look on her face when charlotte is blowing out the candle,positive
every actor in this scene probably thinking damn i shoulda been a fireman,positive
they say that i am the lord of war but i think that it is you its warlord not lord of war thank you but i prefer it my way,positive
god this was amazing if only we had more people like in in real,positive
omg,positive
whos cutting onions,positive

chokes me everytime i watch the post x,positive
wow,positive
gets me every time,positive
this was nice but im more of an hank chicago pd burying suspects in random places type of guy,positive
watching that one womans exprssion leads me to think she may be charlots birth mother,positive
at exactly why do the the chiefs subordinates reactions are in wonder is she his daughter afterall me thinks i could be wrong,positive
i was randomly scrolling reels when this came up i started watching chicago fire that day,positive
so ive been watching this over and over again because i dont watch the show is shirty in the back mean mugging the mother that left her there cuz why she got the stale face for,positive
very powerful,positive
this is such a touching scene its amazing how a single act of kindness can have such a lasting impact we discuss similar stories on our adoption lounge podcast,positive

she met with her dad,positive
thats her birth mother,positive
if shes then im actually,positive
one thing i really like about chief boden is how he trusts his men his fireman leans over and says this ones important chief and he doesnt ask to hear any more just gets up to go,positive
this is from chicago fire se time chief boden is unbelievable here,positive
absolutely great acting,positive
the acting though wow,positive
for all the drugs abuse drunks and pain first responders see and deal with to see even one outcome like this allows them the strength to continue on serving the community if it doesnt then i am afraid you are not in the right profession,positive
why was the woman doing that face in the end,positive
this made me cry,positive
always seen the yt short version of this and the full clip is even better thanks for uploading,positive
i cant believe the actor who plays the fire chief is british wow,positive
you cant even watch this clip without crying let alone this show this show will get you,positive
damn onion cutting ninjas get me on this scene every single freaking time ugh,positive
why did the woman fire fighter look angry or ashamed,positive

how do we get rid of fairy tales,positive
millionaire sitting on the side walk get real get out of here,positive
a sad story i would have ordered anything she wanted for her then take her shopping,positive
please accept my love appreciation and respect to you and your work donot stop humanity is sooooooo dear thank you,positive
this video beautifully illustrates the profound impact of a single act of kindness davids compassion not only transformed christinas life but also brought healing to his own its a powerful reminder that helping others often enriches our own lives in unexpected ways whats one small act of kindness that has stayed with you,positive
halleluiyafrom odishaindia,positive
totally agree,positive
a good story and the kind we need more of its so easy to be kind and we need more people to see that,positive
a heart touching story highlighting responsibility and generosity of mr david this is the manifestation of noble characteristics of humanity but indeed a rare incidence in society otherwise humankind is the most insensitive irrational and inhuman being roaming on the surface of the earth being ruled by the followers of the evil spirit trillions of dollars are being spent and talents engaged in research development and production of weapons of mass destruction to be used in deadly wars and facilitate genocide as in gaza which no doubt a great sin and shame for so called civilized world but not to the leadership of the western countries the lethal weapons already stock piled is enough to destroy several planets like earth yet there is a mad race going on to produce more and more which makes no sense just an act of insanity so far this is the only planet to harbour life so can we afford to destroy it risking our existence whats the answer to those humans who is ruling the world,positive
not bad for an ai generated and read story,positive
excellent story good video,positive
images produced using ai and story totally fancy,positive
nice story however a bit too much how could she work as a hotel housekeeper while also going to nursing school with a young baby did the story teller mean herbabywould bestaying in daycare for shifts hours hoursfor house keeping another for nursing school a bit unrealistic,positive
that simple question holds so much pain and hope the way a single glance can change everything its proof that compassion still has power in this world,positive
,positive
thank you so much good story kind people this is much better,positive
never forget this could be me you at anytime lord givith lord takith away,positive
hello a wonderful moment in time best mike,positive
good story and a great reminder that along the way somewhere we all received some help and as we grow older it is time for us to give back the help to those in need it doesnt have to be this dramatic as portrayed in the video just a small act of kindness to make this place a bit better is all you need,positive
he should go and get her and the baby and move in with him,positive
it is a good moralistic story that everyone needs to be kind and understanding about others difficulties and tough life they lead but i hate the ai generated monotonous and impersonal narration totally devoid of any human feelings,positive
a lovely story does anyone else find it ironic that a story about the value of being truly human is narrated by an ai voice,positive
amen to the blessed women and her child thank you jesus for helping this women amen,positive

ah i just realised on wednesday i will tell how my guide dog was saved by train staff so that is kindness being indirectly returned in action haha it does happen some times in the real world i cannot say how thankful i am for that would not know what i would have done if the train actually had started and my guide dog got hurt or worse so yay to everday heroes,positive
ember here ahhhh this made me cry haha wish reality was more like this sometime it is sometime it is not still videos like this make me smile through the tears also make me feel like my efforts to be kind are actually appreciated which i know they are but ah in a world so cruel a reminder is still nice i already knew i could not watch animals being hurt even in movies without crying and now i know the same goes for acts of kindness rippling haha a bit pathetic but i am imperfectly blind so that is ok also means i am human anyhow thank you for sharing this and making me smile,positive

honestly it breaks my heart how manifest and receive by eva hartley isnt getting the attention it deserves this book changed me people need to wake up to this,positive
everyone who reads this we dont know each other and probably never will but i wish you all the best in life and all the luck in the world if youre struggling right now trust mei know exactly how that feels i spent years working hard but never really getting ahead i thought success was all about effort but i was missing something bigger that changed the moment i read manifest and receive by eva hartley i dont know how to explain it but my income doubled in just a few months and for the first time i feel like i truly understand how wealth works if youre reading this maybe you were meant to wishing you all abundance and success,positive
if youre reading this right now i just want to say im rooting for you were strangers but that doesnt mean i dont care i know what its like to feel like youre pushing a boulder uphill i felt that way until i picked up manifest and receive by eva hartley i cant explain it perfectly but it changed my whole perspective since then things have been flowingmoney peace confidence maybe this is your moment too stay open wishing you more than you ever imagined,positive

a miracle in the operating room on june i was in the operating room of a hospital where i was undergoing a cesarean section for my second daughter and i suffered a fatal hemorrhage suddenly i saw myself falling as if down a rocky shaft i was head up and feet down as if i had entered an elevator and the floor had disappeared and i had plummeted downwards thats how i saw myself descending i didnt know what was happening to me i only felt terrible pain from my cesarean section but it was hundreds of times greater than the pain felt in the physical body i didnt know i had died nor did i know where i was going but i was filled with panic terror an indescribable fear far greater than i could have felt on earth i was falling completely naked my hair flying around all disheveled the further i descended the more terror increased i didnt know where i was going but i sensed i wasnt going to like that place down there as i got closer to the bottom i began to hear agonizing screams like millions of people in constant torment screaming ayyyy yaaa nooo please nooooooooo much for mercy and they also screamed in desperation water aaaguuaaa aaaguuaaa and they cried anguishedly in a heartbreaking way when i heard all this my terror fear panic increased and i screamed desperately my god what is happening to me at that moment i saw a large hand with a wide very white sleeve with blue flashes and at that moment i saw myself in the operating room of the hospital where they performed the cesarean section i was floating above the operating table and surprised i noticed that there was a dead body on said table and when i saw its face i screamed but thats me a second later i saw myself flying upwards i passed some very white clouds and i saw myself dressed in a very white tunic and my hair combed and still i reached the top something like a large hallway and on my left side i could see a large garden with beautiful flowers birds and multicolored butterflies all in soft colors i saw that everything is alive there is no death i noticed that the flowers and everything i saw were singing in a soft tone even the air itself everything was praising god in unison out of the corner of my eye something caught my attention on my right side and when i turned around i saw a large halfopen door from which a beautiful golden light was coming out curiosity got the better of me and i tried to walk over there to see what was behind that large door but i couldnt move it seemed like there was glue under my feet and in that instant i saw him he was standing between me and the door majestic beautiful it was jesus he was so tall that i could only see the right side of his body from the shoulder down just before his feet i never saw his face he was dressed in a very white robe with a gold belt i saw him raise his hand and instinctively knew he was going to bring me back so i raised my arms and said no lord he told me literally its not your time yet you have to return to earth because you have a ministry to fulfill there immediately i saw my spirit entering my dead physical body and i woke up and groaned weakly a cleaning lady was cleaning up the blood i had left there in the operating room when she saw me moving and complaining she ran out tripping getting up and the dead woman is alive the dead woman is alive the dead woman is alive in an instant the doctors arrived and when they saw that i was alive they couldnt believe it and said to each other it cant be she doesnt have a drop of blood or any other fluid in her body and shed been dead for minutes this has to be a miracle and they filled my entire body with needles injecting me with blood at full speed ivs and glucose my gynecologist said put her in such and such a room this girl wont last hours and look at me years have passed since then but this isnt all months later at the end of november i had another experience with death i suffered a massive heart attack and died suddenly i found myself standing on a beach and i saw again that great hand that had pulled me out of hell in that hand he held my shattered heart he put his hand into the sea and when he pulled it out he had a new beating heart and placed it in my chest i woke up from death for the second time i thanked god for giving me my spiritual birth john and what literally happened to me is what is written in ezekiel where jehovah says i will remove the heart of stone and give you one of flesh and i will make it beat and you will be my people and i will be your god before all this i did not believe in god or heaven or hell but now i understand that they do exist all are real many follow doctrines of men and demons they are deceived and lost for not knowing god i recommend that you read the reina valera bible i have years of ministry i began as a christian missionary a bible teacher of sound doctrine preaching in prisons and on the streets to drug addicts and prostitutes many souls won for christ and i never asked for money to work in the work of god jesus gave us everything for free so let us give freely free of charge what we have freely received the gospel of jesus is not for sale it should not be profited from eternal glory to him christ loves you true testimony of what christ did for me alma rodriguez,positive

so beautiful truly,positive
please stopplayingnthe music so loud i cant hear the dialogue,positive
because of the thumbnail i thought the title said the most embarrassing moments i was about to lose my shit in the comments then i reread but that nurse hmmmmm emotional thats debatable,positive
the narrator ruined it i dont need the explanation over the videos just show the video,positive
men have no reason to hide their tears a real man willcan show his emotions it makes me love them even more,positive
for the doctor one my sister understands it well she works in a nursing home and she cries whenever she loses one of the residents there especially ones shes close with in terms of being nice and taking care of them and whatnot its heartbreaking regardless,positive
had to pause as i watched this to comment that boy little boy at his mothers grave just heartwrenching its so sad and even sadder that none of those who passed by took a moment to show him some love just a pat on the back a hug or something could have gone a long way,positive
that guy who helped that runner gets me every time,positive
the world is not wicked its a persons perception of the world that makes it good or bad,positive
great video but the constant brain time being pushed after every video ruins it they are not even your clips lol not sure why you need to ruin all these great heartwarming videos with your brand,positive
,positive
cant you film normally these days always that toaster feeling horrible i have a large laptop screen but i almost have to use a magnifying glass to look at it,positive
the doctor thing is bullshit she put a cam before cryingyeah,positive
visited by guy friends and wont look at themthen goes crying like a mor on,positive
pretty cringe that she just recorded her reaction after that,positive
that father in the wheelchair with his daughter broke me im in a wheelchair and to see someone being able to live a life and make his own family happy is the best thing ive ever seen,positive
bless the children,positive
the blonde dr or nurse in the blue scrubs in the hallway always gets to me the things she must see and keeps going back truly an angel,positive
the old woman who cried at her son visiting her was so wholesome i wish my grandmother was still alive i would give anything to hug her like that again,positive
,positive
videos that break me the most are grown men crying over soemthing like a child delivering the adoption papers alot of people shit on us dudes but damn we do have emotions as well my gods,positive

the only thing that ruins it is barney the dinosaur interrupting,positive
,positive
aloha hugs thats the same jet pilot i talked to at costco about weeks ago anyway he looks just a kind,positive
there is no doubt little girls seeeverything,positive
where did the person find the place to get a stuffed animal made in the likeness of their departed dog id love to do this for my wife,positive
the cat and the dr hitted my heart the most to be honest with ya all i didnt knew that animals could be as sad as a human being since cats usually take it on their chin and dont seem to care that much,positive
why do you have to cry for a plushie h,positive
even better when the narrator doesnt chime in during the scene,positive
we need so many more of these kind of videos im not crying its allergies,positive
some of you folks scare me you dont break until the cat video at you made it through the boy showing his homework to his dead mother oh thats nice and the soldier greeting his baby for the first time oh thats a cute baby but its the fing cat that really gets you absolutely telling,positive
thanks the people who got the jackets got me crying i know what that feels like big time and the kitten and cats the one with frostbite the other who saw his deceased owner on screen and the dog who got found my dogs recognise every person on screen and on the phone their expressions weigh a million,positive

to those people who dont feel any emotions towards other peoples emotions i feel sorry for you,positive
its so hard to make those certain kinds of people to understand just how painful truly painful it is when u lose ur best friend ur legged child i lost my bb girl my cat abby my husband jokingly would say that i loved her more than him lol she only loved me it amazed him to see an animal truly loving a human being there wasnt anything i wouldnt do for her i shared my food beverages with her she would sit with me wherever i was sitting id always give her more than half of the chairs we sat together on with of my butt hanging off she loved sleeping under the blankets against my body in the little nook when id sleep on my side i was always scared shed suffocate under there so with my arm id sleep with my arm up under the blanket making a tent for her under there or shed sleep on top of the blanket on top of my hip bone i would always make sure she was comfortable content believe me or dont but in yrs she not once not ever hiss growl or bitescratch me out of anger never i could go on on about the love we shared she was everything to me even though a part of me knew she would pass before me but it always felt like wed be together forever always she had a red string that was her favorite toy for yrs i now sleep can not sleep without it ever she died in my arms i watched her beautiful green eyes going black oh god this is just too much abigail cupcake fyffe ill never let her go,positive
the man with the stuffed dog i felt that pain,positive

i rode on amtrak with my yearold daughter the employees ensured me that the ride was about hours long but it turned out to be hours i had only brought enough food for meals i had no money the passengers fed me and my daughter for the other hours same daughter in junior high was stealing from me and selling my things at school the school brought me in and asked me not to punish her they then asked me if it was true that i had been going without food in order to take care of our family i tried to deny it and then told them it wasnt a problem for me they brought us food and then provided christmas for our family of also in wisconsin whenever i or anyone else slid off the icy roads multiple people would stop and help and would not leave until the driver was back on the road one long road trip going through kansas my car broke down with me and my little girls on a highway around midnight it was very dark and freezing and the traffic was going mph on average with a small shoulder off the side of the highway the next exit was maybe miles down the road a couple took the next exit went back the other way and took that exit and then came back and stopped to help they had called for a tow truck and then gave us a ride offering to allow us to stay the night in their home with them in stlouis mo a young man stopped to change my tire on the freeway i told him it wasnt necessary since id called my insurance co and then had called for a tow truck which would arrive in an hour he didnt think we were safe on the side of the freeway and so he changed my tire all by himself and refused payment that same trip a police officer pulled me over for having expired tags wed visited family in the south for christmas and the car was packed to the brim with christmas gifts the officers took us to our apartment cant drive on expired tags and unloaded everything in that car an elderly neighbor knew i was struggling and when she burned her back and shoulder falling asleep on a heating pad she insisted on paying me an outrageous amount to apply her burn cream until she healed while there are plenty of people who do not care and even plenty who enjoy the pain and suffering of others there are a whole lot of people who are kind and generous these are only a few of the times i have experienced kindness from complete strangers,positive

im when i was young and pregnant for the first time at months when the baby hadnt kicked or move for days a high temperature happened i went into labor after arriving at the hospital the nurses and doctor said they couldnt hear a heartbeat they were careful not to say the baby had probably died maybe because there was still going to have to be the birthing of it and they didnt want me to be very upset before and during it so after it was born and i didnt hear any crying and no one said anything i said is it alive the doctor said no upon hearing what he said there happened a great paining gasp into crying the young intern who was present immediately lifted the upper part of my body up in his arms and started rocking it theres not forgetting such compassionate kindness when theres great pain,positive

the tests arent even looking for a virus of any type all theyre doing is looking for things that may or may not be there if there was a virus present not specifically covid but those things may or may not be there for a ton of other reasons too one being if youve had a flu shot there is no real test for covid because there is no covid,positive
they said the year old lady just beat covid then they said she had pneumonia earlier this year so its possible she really had pneumonia but i bet the docs put down covid even though she never had the covid,positive
we are the news now q posted this story yesterday,positive
seeing am older woman wearing a face mask in this heat is not my definition of a feel good moment face masks are the new aluminium foil hats except for that aluminium foil hats dont limit your oxygen intake by up to twenty percent and force you to breathe your own carbon dioxide thats not good for you for a ton of reasons one of them being that it will drastically lower your immune system which will make it easier for you to catch non h o a x related illnesses they will also make you a lot more susceptible to things like heart attacks strokes and even cancer before the covid h o a x in the state of new york for example if you wanted to wear a face mask on the job for occupations like drywallling landscaping construction painting etcyou had to get checked out by and have a form filled out by a doctor stating that you are healthy enough to wear a face mask and even then theyre still a health hazard recently two chinese students died because they were wearing face masks all the time and a chinese man had his left lung collapse after jogging a couple of miles while wearing a face mask my medical condition is that i absolutely require one hundred percent of the oxygen available to me as well as having to expel one hundred percent of the carbon dioxide within me with each exhale they also cannot force you to disclose your medical reasons for not wearing a face mask if you dont want a hassle just tell them you cannot wear one for medical reasons im just going to tell them no,positive

wierd kevin dint run out at light speed like stanley did during pretzel day,positive
jims greatest practical joke ever having michael replace him as dwights best man at his wedding,positive
i like andyhe deserves more,positive
lol,positive
the only time stanley and micheal are friends is pretzel day,positive
i dont blame creed cartwheels are hard to do,positive
the was angela smiles is soo pure,positive
michael ruined this,positive
great video,positive
erin has so much energy positive or chaotic but energy in the end,positive
pretzel day is my fav episode well settle down scott the way he says that,positive
thats all i had to do all year oh creed,positive
in german hahaha,positive
ill forever hate toby for stopping dwight and andy playing that song,positive
i kid you not these moments are the reason i watch tv,positive
micheal at pam art gallery,positive
so disappointed that jim and pams wedding wasnt in this video,positive
i love when the manager of chilis says that pams is banned from chilis,positive
song name please it sounds fire,positive
another really feel good moment for me was when michael negotiated successfully and had his way when dm wanted to buy out the michael scott paper company,positive
dwights reaction to the bobblehead and angelas little smile makes me teary eyed every time,positive
coming soon ahhhhhh,positive
i love how the absolute first thing dwight does as manager is get jims seat back,positive
the only time michael and stanley agreed on something,positive
watching angela singing along is so wholesome,positive
is that first clip rainn over the intercom,positive
i wanna hear the full version of andy and dwight playing country road,positive
that earned my like on his video more than any other video ive ever given the thumbs up too great finisher at the end with erin micheal and then micheal doing the dance off verse himself lol solid greatness,positive
i love that jim thinks pam is hilarious,positive
that last scene with michael and erin is absolutely mental rofl,positive
dwight and andy singing gives me chills its so heartfelt and ofc hilarious when toby stops them lol,positive
i feel god in this chilis tonight awesome line,positive
id absolutely love drunk pam,positive
the last one,positive
im the bobblehead,positive
oh how i love the office,positive
dwights pure joy at the bobble head is my favourite moment of the series,positive
a relationship like jim and pams is literally all i want in my life,positive
you missed cafe disco,positive
jim coming back to his desk after that tough day and listening to pams voicemails is so great its really nice to know someone cares,positive
pretzelday the only day in the year michael and stanley can agree on something,positive
no doubt pam is a pretzel day hater she hates all good things like jim having a good life in phylly,positive
i feel god in this chilis tonight best quote ever,positive
that cartwheel was absolutely amazing the best ive ever seen,positive
pam was miscast imo,positive
i completely got michaels hate towards toby when he broke that duet andy and dwight were nailing it,positive
stanley ran out with joy on his face for that pretzel lol michael snuck out asked for everything on his pretzel the works funny show,positive
i also think its hilarious how erin walked away when dwight and andy just started jamming once they werent paying attention to her anymore she was like fine ill just go away i was just happy they put aside their pettiness and avoided another angela debacle,positive
i love the way kevin and oscar look at jim like did that really just happen,positive
i love when cathy was trying to seduce jim but the night ended with jim and dwight eating ice cream on the bed while watching tv,positive
jim asking pam out when pam thought all hope was lost to be with him was a beautiful moment and the beginning of a beautiful relationship in the show,positive
oh my gosh no wonder micheal hates toby that much in this extremely joyful montage toby was the only one who ruined it in the middle of it i was singing along with dwight and andy for gods sake,positive
jesus loves you repent of your sins and turn to him today believe that he died in the cross for your sins and rose again three days later and you shall be saved romans,positive
i feel so bad for jim in this scene he just had his first kiss with the girl of his dreams but because she was drunk now hes gotta go back to normal,positive
noice,positive
idk what it is but every scene with erin makes me smile,positive
one of the most criminally underrated moments was dwight and andys cover of country roads the fact that its never been revisited in a reunion makes this world seem a little colder,positive
toby killed one of the best duets ever,positive
the good moments pam kissing jim is not the best moment for roy i would say,positive
creed bratton is the new manager,positive
pam is,positive
probably my most favorite part of jim pam relationship,positive
did phyllis just call him rainn,positive
im reading a lot of comments claiming to hate erin and the onyl thing i can say is id fight every single person who is against you kelly erin hannon,positive
this is missing micheal and erins heart to heart which ends in micheal grounding her,positive
my ballls itchhhhh dont delete,positive
i cant remember when was the last time i do cartwheel,positive
i thought michaels video at the end was genius,positive
im starting to see why michael hates toby so much,positive
love how stanley and michael teamed up on pretzel day one of my favorite moments,positive
its the simple things that brings the most joy,positive
andy singing for the last time in the office,positive
nothing tops jim and pam scenes in this show as they are real and romantic and so well written and acted,positive
when toby stopped dwight and andys duet of take me home country roads i understood right then and there why michael hates toby,positive
god i hate toby so much,positive
the flintstones theme song on the bus is such a small scene but its one of my favorites,positive
why didnt they add the video from jim to pam or michael seeing dwight after years of waiting,positive
i understood micheals hatred for toby when he interrupted that beautiful moment between dwight and andy while they were playing their instruments,positive
ngl dwight becoming manager made me cry,positive
toby buzzkillerson,positive
erins birth parents showing up should be here haha makes me cry every time,positive
see you tomorrow boss by creed is definitely a sadhappy moment when michael is leaving while hes drinking out of his mug,positive
how in the hell is kevin not sprinting towards the pretzels haha i call foul sir but the fact stanley initiated the high five was wholesome knowing whats coming in the future,positive
i would love to have a manager like michael,positive
haha dwight told michael the aristocrats joke lol,positive
this mix is so jim and pam barf,positive
you should have added the jim and pam wedding scene,positive
i wanted to hear dwight tell the aristocrats in full,positive
the way dwight and andy looked at each other mid verse as if to convey nonverbally that they are worthy of each other and the music must go on soul,positive
holycrap dwight told the aristocrats joke ive never noticed that,positive
i need an erin in my life,positive
there is no better moment than jim telling pam they have a date this is literally the best feel good moment,positive
whattt is the name of the song at,positive
lord fprgive my bitterness,positive
stanley booing phyllis will always be my favorite,positive
dammit toby dont stop dwight and andys jam session i wish they had sung and played country roads even longer its so good,positive
love how michael told creed ill stay as long as it takes when he was doing the cartwheel it was a really sweet moment,positive
the cheese ball scene doesnt fit,positive
,positive
nobody dwightandy toby hey you have to stop,positive
erin is probably one of the sweetest characters in this office,positive
lol i wonder if the flintstones bit was scripted cause it seems so genuine,positive
this videos editor michael going to pams art show creeds cartwheel,positive
kind of feel bad for andy at the end,positive
michaeltalks about productivity also michael gets in line and does zero work,positive
besties,positive
this was the ultimate bonding session between these three,positive
a,positive
yeah creed close enough,positive
is why michael hates toby,positive
andy and dwight doing their duet was noice,positive
andy and dwight forgetting they were fighting over erin when they started jamming was so wholesome,positive
whew always get chills and tear up,positive
after the singing from dwight and andy in the breakroom i can understand why michael hates toby so much,positive
stanley is my favorite character,positive
thats a relatable expression,positive
pam drunk,positive
pams voicemails are running in background when jim is getting out of the office that scene was smooth,positive
velmaaaaaaaa,positive
when i was i worshiped the cringe when i was i appreciated the humor and saw all of them in my workplace now at i cry tears of joy and love for the greatest show ever created oh what whats that about the moment the office died hey dude i just found this on the ground its a little bag that contains your sense of humor and love for your friends i think you might have dropped it i hope you can get it back inside yourself thats what she said idiot,positive
even though it wasnt exactly perfect it was so cute how michael was trying to help creed do a cartwheel,positive
lll never forgive toby for ruining this,positive
god i needed that thank you,positive
its the get out of jims seat for me,positive
i see ask every time why didnt kevin go crazy about the pretzel,positive
erin can really make everything a feel good moment,positive
toby did not have a feel good moment,positive
thats the only time ive ever seen stanley agree with micheal,positive
no discussion jim finally asking pam to go on a date pams emotion is priceless,positive
kevins face is always priceless,positive
wow stanleys pathetic,positive
every one of these scenes is incredibly meticulous from excellent writers they keep you liking the characters even when the episode plots make them insane lol,positive
the michael dance scene was nice tbh,positive
i still find andy and dwight version of take me home better than originalno offense to original,positive
didnt realise dwights resolution was to meet a loose woman,positive
me encant est sper padre,positive
i am a bavarian and i am offended like most bread in america this is an offense to germany and bread itself,positive
the scene where jim asks pam for dinner and she smiles the biggest grin ever is my favourite scene of the whole series,positive
love the cheese balls,positive
erin is hot af lol,positive
not gonna lie i cried,positive
phyllis would definitely never let them cut in line,positive
the scene with creeds cart wheel is the most amazing thing ive seen in this show incredibly funny in its simplicity,positive
someone put that dwightandy jam sesh on spotify please,positive
i love everybody singing flintstones,positive
one of the only shows that makes you shed tears of joy,positive
oh a big line,positive
its hilarious when toby says you have to stop,positive
i hated toby for stopping country road cover by dwight and andy,positive
im a dude i cry ive lost both my parents i cry about it from time to time men have feeling too i dont know if i want to live in this world anymore if this is what is becoming the norm,positive
,positive
i told myself if i ever knew a man who thinks he not allowed cry i would tell him hes human crying doesnt make you weak saying your sad makes you strong show up for yourself and be there you can cry they are not weak and dont kill yourself,positive
when you feel like you lost everything you feel empty every single day u feel like your dying slowy,positive
im a female myself but im not gonna tell a man or anyone that they cant cry i know someone whos gone through things didnt tell anyone but me no one played attention no one cared many people say women go through more pain physically yes men mentally,positive
a mans silence is his biggest cry,positive
god man this hurts,positive
im and i have never told anyone this before but a few years ago about when i was i think me and my brother were brushing our teeth before bed he was like or smth and after we finished i was light night love you and he said it back and he closed the door to the bathroom and i was going up the stairs to my room and i heard him cryingi didnt say anything i never told him that i heard him or anyone else and whenever i think about it it just makes me so sad because my dad is like always yelling at him and blaming everything on him but i think hes kinda depressed,positive
this is literally just one giant finger pointing game of who dropped there balls first bro like are we serious,positive
youre calling us men we have you look at yourself lately you are always cry about the littlest stuff,positive
having the guts the audacity to say men arent allowed to cry some people dont understand our pain,positive
the worst part about growing up is that all your friends stop hanging around with you and you might think the brose before hoes is fake because like they all get into a relationship and stop playing with you because like the grown people now happened to my friend but hes online dating now,positive
girls listen to this im a boy and we have hearts and feelings inside and outside so please respect the men and littles boys like me and im hurting of my dogs died,positive
rip,positive
i cry in every place anywhere i dont care,positive
for da boys,positive
for people to know the truth why we boys do this is because girls being stereotypic and thinking have to be tuff and not cry like a baby and this have being going more then a decade so we have to keep it like this,positive
i am a girl and boys are just like girls there humans so why wouldnt they be able to cry infront of us there humans they have feelings too,positive
men weak lol lady men are the ones that created the world we carried more than you think,positive
its ok for men to cry they are humans at the end everyone is a human at the end and no matter what othe girls think i a female think its ok for males to cry as they are humans at the end they are humans not some robots who have no emotions they are allowed to cry,positive
i have been a victim of wanting to kill myself i have gotten told that i shouldnt exist in the first place by a girl and more women have made fun of me but god said no he did not let me kill myself i thought about everything and i realized the only thing to get any stress is off my mind nothing else but now ive i do something for women that i didnt have to do for example clean up their mess or something i do not get a thank you i just get called a weirdo,positive
as a girl its perfectly ok for boys to cry its normal to cry everyone crys but stupid pick me girls always say it wrong for boys to cry everyone crys to all the boys reading this comment never feel ashamed because a dumb girl says its weak for boys to cry,positive
everyone has went through something woman or not its the same thing wise manwoman,positive
im a dude even if im a child its the same i didnt lose my parents but they separated a long time ago years ago and whenever someone mentions them being together for example someone asked me one time do your mom and your dad ever leave you home alone to go on a date cause i love that i asked him to just gimme a second because i started to cry light at the thought of them being together men should also be able to have feelings and men crying is not a weakness if your able to let yourself cry in front of women or anybody that is a strength to be able to do that and your wife or girlfriend has to be okay with that and if they think were weak they are not the one for us because if they say your weak when you cry their heart is grey and has no colour because if someone crues youre supposed to either ask them if theyre ok and give them space or help them calling them weak should not be an option for anyone what so ever everybody should to able to express theyre dealing however they want except for raging out and breaking stuff has to put a bit of humor lol,positive
if men need to cry they should be able to but just like anyone else i dont think that saddens should stop you from anything this is for everyonemen women all this is coming from a woman,positive
says the women who probably wasted all her time putting on make up bro this is why you dont have a boyfriend and this is why your parents are disappointed,positive
we are not toyswe are men and men are,positive
so they always cry alone,positive
i am a girl who is and even i know its okay for men to cry if i cant keep myself from crying i sure as hell dont want my man to hide their feelings so cry if you need sob if you need to i dont mind because even you are a person and humans are meant to feel emotions i support you through every emotion be kind and stay humble,positive
this video makes me remember when my girlfriend broke up with me till this day i am so sad,positive
i felt like this when i broke up with my girlfriend,positive
the only times ive cried real tears was when i saw my friend die and no other man was crying thats when i realized you cant cry if youre a man in this society,positive
bro like why do girls not care about men like gods a man mans fight for u mans care and ur saying its not ok for them to cry in fort of u what a messed up gender,positive
i want my boyfriend to know he can cry in front of me that im there for him even even hes crying,positive
she told me a joke if my parents find out im dating you im getting pulled out of our school she said she wasnt joking it has been days without contact from her and since she was last online i cry a lot and i will never date anyone only because she was the best she said if my parents break us up just know we are automatically dating shes the only person that was kindest to me,positive
so no one goin text,positive
this is me fr,positive
do not forget that the words are the most hurting do not let them consume you,positive
so here i am again my dad left the house when i was abt years old and i said over and over again to myself i was the reason he left and then i grow up he tryed and tryed but my mom would not let him see us me and my brother were always fighting and my mom was like hell when the bills came in and she had to look for a new job so she did and got a job at her old high school and th grade i liked this girl but she didnt like me and she dated me friend who said he didnt like so i found new friends but i liked sumone else and then she didnt like me and she was moving away and i broke down and told myself to keep pushing and then i founs the girl i thought was the one but she alright had a boyfriend and it was my friend but sumtimes i didnt know if she liked me too because she would say stuff weird and then i got a gf sumone i didnt even like but sumthing in my head said date her and you will heal and i did and then she told me she liked sumone else and wanted to broke up i just said alright i cry over and over thinking what can i do what did i do to be played like that and then one the last day of school the girl i first liked came to me and give me the biggest hug and it was me first hug for sumone that wasnt in my family so she came on giving me hug and when we left the school we end up with around hugs and i felt like she liked me because she would be talking to me and took a photo with me too so i dont know and now im goin into middle school,positive
yes everyone has feelings humans have feelings doesnt matter if your guy or a girl you start feeling you let it out,positive
as a women every boy or man can cry in front of woman im sorry to any one who feels like this,positive
as a girl im generally disappointed at other girls who literally just dont get how guys actually have feelings too like thats so disrespectful guys are people too theyre not your toys or anything their people human beings and deserve to be treated like one for all guys reading this have a great day,positive
honestly for me as a girl its a big huge yessss for me bc ur feelings matter the most and they are not there to be more judged i say this bc ur sadness makes u stronger and not weaker if u were my man i would take care of u no matter what u feel about the inside and outside bc we all have tears for a reason like when we feel sad we cry mad we cry to bring out whats holding whatever we going through and feeling lonely and bored we cry bc we got nobody to talk to or feeling like we wanna kill ourself bc for some reason so yeah i cear if u cry in front of me crying is normal for all of us people crying doesnt mean ur weak just remember that,positive
girl here the standard that men cant cry and if they cry there weak is so dumb like women get mad men stereotype woman but here woman are saying you cant cry bc ur a man so stupid my man felt like he couldnt cry and i tell him im always here forever and always and i wont judge him i would just hold him and comfort bc he would do the same,positive
im a girl and guys if u need to cry well cry ur not weak ur a human being with emotions no girls have the right to tell you u cant cry a real man is a man who knows how to show emotions,positive
im a guy im young and really depressed my parents were mentally and physically abusive a lot of times raised by narcissist and cant function properly i lost the only people that cared for me and have thought about committing the s word but im trying to get help and push myself one day at a time,positive
if a man cries they are not weak they have been strong for too long a wise man,positive
i cant show im in pain every single day im getting bullied by family or by someone else i lost two people that i love more than my brother and my mom,positive
if a woman says that then she deserves nothing,positive
,positive
i got cheated on times i wanna see jesus,positive
as someone who doesnt get placed into either gender to me i feel useless if im crying in front of people yet they care for me while others push me away and tell me to suck it up,positive
my big brother once cried in front of me and it broke my heart,positive
boys do cry they cry bc they are hurt they cry bc they are heatbroken they cry bc they are a failure they cry bc they are facing family problems boys are not robots they have feelings they hold there cry and they wish they should die,positive
to all men women opinions dont matter because theyre girls and but remember god is always there for you and im a women but i get it life is not all rainbows and sun shines its also rainy and cloudy js know someone who wont ignore you is god dont listen to ppls opinions its normal to cry and if you need to then let it out or talk to an adult about it,positive
i have been heart broken so many times and i am just surrounded by deaths of family that my tears are dried out as dark as it may seem it doesnt matter no one cares anymore,positive
im not a guy but men can show their emotion people stop saying crap like men cant cry your a man not a girl dont cry guys dont even get support when they wanna kill themselves like seriously why cant guys just express their emotions like girls and then when they cry their called weak seriously why cant you people just accept the fact men should be able to express their emotions like girls can,positive
woman use men so much that they forget that we are human beings just like everyone else,positive
woman cause depression,positive
that girl is stupid there are a lot of people like that as a woman i think crying is okay no matter if you are a woman or a man for all those who are sad since i cant physically hug youhere is a virtual hug from me for you,positive
why are people like this,positive
bro,positive
hey im back bc i didnt get a good day,positive
we have tear ducts dont we,positive
girls the weeknd pathetic i dont want you and you dont even fight for us a mistake boys boys do everything we lift things we do everything we have cops thats men we risk our lives for our family we do all of the things and you dont appreciate it,positive
so men cant cry when they get broken up with they cant cry in front of their mother thats what im hearing and thats not wrong crying is a part of life it reliefs stress dont let anyone control you except yourself cry when you have to its healthy,positive
i feel bad for them,positive
bro i would rather die than tell anyone about my life,positive
if you say men cant cry your basically saying that men cant show emotions and function like a normal human being,positive
i am a dude and i dont think women dont understand us men it is truly heartbroken,positive
im a girl and its ok to cry in front of woman becuz what if their going through something and u dont know it,positive
men are not weak i cry in front of doesnt everybody crying second grade in front of girls in my dad cries in front of my mom all the time and i cry in front of my friend thats a girl,positive
we are built with walls around us scared to show and share our feelings im contemplating life everyday but i try to stay strong as i can i have ones that depend on me and i wont let them down i will be here till the big man takes me i try to reach out to people when i see them down or hurting i try to keep them stable and know that their not the only one,positive
im and i still go through this do you know why we play video games all day to escape from reality i mean all i can say is want to die man do you know how many times i thought of killing myself man i have my life we are afraid to tell other me we need to cry i mean men cant trust anyone the only one that brings me joy is my sister but hates i dont know what to do with my life,positive
yes it is,positive
honestly its perfectly fine for men to cry dosent matter where they are they could be with a bunch of women but its like they have feelings too like like us women and girls up there just because you cry and that make us not a woman because were still a woman after we cry that means men are still men after they cry it doesnt make them less weak they have emotions and they have feelings just like us women,positive
i cried over this girl,positive
im a guy and i cry im actually crying right now,positive
people want to kill themselves bc a woman,positive
let me say a joke women,positive
i cant stand anymore i guess i will burn,positive
my dad was in the military and he died years ago and im still sad i love u dad,positive
most women are just stupidthey play with mens hearts but when they crythey are weak,positive
the fact that lots of these women are saying that toxic masculinity needs to be stopped are the same ones who call us wimp when we dont show emotion this isnt an oversimplification this is just what ive seen a few people say in my life not all people are like this and its been making me feel pointless as someone whos in youth theater but also manly somewhat and being expected by most people to just be okay with anything,positive
i cry all the time infront of everyone im really sensitive and then everyone just annoys me more and laughs at me sometimes im in my bed feeling like a faliure,positive
in life there are conditions that break us on the contrary we should try to protect others from these thats what god has sent us to this world for like in my country there is a lot corruption in the field of sports my parents are against of me playing and become a pro soccer player and even i know that in my country a middle class boy cant go pro without politics and money which i dont have but ive taken a vow that when i grow up ill make dream of every soccer kid to go pro ill fund their talent ill bring revolution of football in my country so that no other boy like om joshi me will be heartbroken by this reality thank you and god bless you brothersister who had time to read the accolade of a yr old boy,positive
its because where weak no its because we also have feelings and thats okay for us men to show that where not always the tough people you think we are,positive
me to i want to but im scared,positive
men are not weak ladies are not weak,positive
i believe men can cry like its normal everyone crys i let my ex cry in my arms for hours and i would hold him and make sure he was okay,positive
i may be a womanbut everyone is equal and should show and be respected for having feelings,positive
men can cry you have a dad and that men does everthing for you he crys when you are not there,positive
as a woman yea i would let him cry i would support them and help them feel better,positive
men were put on this earth for a single purpose to serve not serve themselves serve others mens emotions are irrelevant and should never be expressed as they hinder our ability to properly serve you cant fight a war with feelings you cant hunt a deer with feelings as a man you should be completely emotionless you should be a machine because thats whats expected no demanded and i do mean any emotion well surely im allowed to be happy right no nothing never these socalled positive emotions soften us and thats dangerous when we hear that men are supposed to be rocks it is meant literally if you want to succeed and carry out your duties as a man like youre supposed to you have to feel nothing its the only way,positive
my cranpa has cancer and gonna die way do you think men cant cry,positive
i think hurting myself all the time,positive
gender is not related to showing emotion what makes us human is our compassion warmth and love and if thats going to be genderbased then the ones implying that need to change,positive
the problem is that many men are changing and do want to talk but who will listen when a guy goes online and says you know sometimes its hard being a man he will usually get bombarded by posts about how women have it worse and how his life is privileged and perfect so stop moaning like its a zero sum game or something lets blame men oh they dont talk when the elephant in the room is that no one wants to hear what they have to say anyway many men are changing now its the rest of societies turn stop condemning us would be a start ill wait,positive
boys life is easy wrong boys life is hard with girls and bully correct,positive
i dont mind if men cry shows me that theyre strong enough to show me vulnerability,positive
without men you would not be able to eat kg of food in a day,positive
woman wonder why men are rude to woman and they do this sht,positive

after taking call one right after another and dealing with assholes who want you to wipe their diaper and perform miracles through the phone you get a defensive attitude and get to be predisposed with good customers it is much harder to handle than just following the callflow protocoles whiney customer dont coperate at all and this attitude is the outcome from all of that training is the must unreal thing vs what you actually get to face,negative
you dont need to call a center help your selfis my that you are on useles dont wase my time calling that you can resolve,negative
i mean i see no issue here customers always go on this long pointless tale of a issue and what led up to itwhat they had on at the time the issue occurred they never just go straight to the point i cut my customers off as well when it comes to technical supportim here to provide a solution not hear ongoing pointless rants etc im straight to the point lol a few probing questionsok thats the issue heres a resolution alright have a great day,negative

i work at a call center this is so painful to watch,negative
she should get a job with the irs shes a lot nicer and patient than they are,negative
see this is the problem no one wants to hear this dude lifestory but the women could have been a bit more polite at the end not make it so obvious dammm gurl,negative

how does this have k views,negative
shes not exhibiting any bad service call centers want you to end the call as fast as possible but customers ask stupid shit keep you on the phone forever and dont listen to directions and then complain to a supe if you say something they dont like,negative
but a new one asshole,negative
he was pretty nice i wouldnt have minded being pleasant to him its the nasty ones that try you,negative
customer yes i just said that when employees dont listen xd,negative
there are ppl who call talking way to much and end up talking about their life like yyyy,negative
the lady i can tell is burned out on the phone,negative
i think the customer service representative was sounding too aggressive towards the customer she didnt show any empathy towards him she shows a lot of mean and tiresome facial expression when all she needed to do as a customer service representative was show concern and show that shes willing to listen and meet his needs she also shows her exhaustion in her voice at a point when the customer realize it was his fault by not checking to see if the bag was empty she also terms her words to let him notice it was his fault and not theirs a customer service representative should at no time let a customer feel guilty for calling even if its their fault the customer is always right and that customer service representative didnt carry out her job quite as she was supposed to she seemed as though she just really want to end the call she didnt even show a smile on her face she was stern right through the call and customer probably feel bullied by the customer service representative a customer service representative should sound pleasant at all time and show gratitude towards customers they should at all times be ready to assist and remain that way and never let a customer notice your exhaustion towards them,negative
its funny when you ask them how can i help you and they say well let me start by saying that when god created the world yala yala yala jejjjee,negative
i worked in a couple of call centersi loved the jobsi was one of the best representativesi ve got several certificates of how well i did ecti have been on customer end too and most call center employees dont care the thing i dislike the most is when i get to a representative after waiting good amount of timethe rep hangs up or puts me on hold never checks back so i hang upnow flip side i would ve liked to have seen less people being very exploitive in languagecompany policy was you make effort to get customer to talk but three times of customer not wanting to quit course language theni explain why i m hanging up the phonethen nd type customer just crazycust calls in has a problem not wanting to listen to me rep then call ends abruptly when cust hangs up then cust calls right back in gets me same rep cust is likeomg the last representative i spoke too was so rude and this n thati had customers i had to tell them i was the last one you spoke with x amount of minutes ago because they had unrealistic expectations,negative
the customer support rep lost control of the call from the begging and all went down hill from that point the rep needs serious training on all levels if she knew how to do her job she could have regained control of the call easily and helped the customer and properly represented the company she is working for years ago i worked for ibm on first level support before moving up and this type of performance would not have been tolerated all calls were monitored at ibm and this rep would have been pulled in for coaching immediately and if she did not improve she would have been let go,negative
shes sick of customer bullst,negative
fake,negative
she did nothing wrong and i thought this was a great call keep up the good work sexy white woman,negative
if he cant see her attitude no harm no foul,negative
fuck stupid ass customers fuck them all because they need to get a brain before they call,negative
customers like him who need to explain their entire fucking life storiesjust fucking telling me what you need or stfu and let me tell you what you need,negative
this is obviously used as training for call center employees on what not to do,negative
ok she was passive aggressive and very condescending even if the customer was in the wrong she could have made a positive or lite of the situation no harm done except shes getting paid to be uninterested,negative
no he wasnt stupid that bitch was rude,negative
please do more of these,negative
lmao stupid customer,negative
i get dumb ass calls like this all the time and i respond like her when i am trying to get the customer to think straight it can be frustrating i dont have a rude tone like her often but i give them short responses watching these videos to try and do better but sometimes folks call talk to me like i am a lap dog or something especially when they cant get a rate or availability of the hotel they wanted any tips thank you,negative
looks faked she is the only person in a busy call center,negative
what a bitch id call her a straight up bitch if she talked to me like that lol,negative
usually when the customers call they already upset they are not satisfied with solution of the rep they are close minded no matter what you said to them are not listening to you as agent no choice you have to absorb all the bad words saying to you,negative
tanya is hilarious,negative
awesome video gary u just got a new sub and a new like,negative
shes not rude,negative
i hope some of you realize this is not a real call,negative
i think that guy was stupid,negative
no empathy sarcastic tone heaving breathing on the phone could mean something to the customer no recap on the call for the customer not to call back again though full control of the call theres no good customer service on it,negative
how i wish att customer reps were as kind as she was seriously,negative
fake and gay,negative
i dont think the customer service rep did anything poorly other than maybe interrupt the customers incredibly tedious description of what was going on she gave suggestions on what could be the problem and then nailed it she couldve been more cheerful perhaps but other than that she provided a solution typically reps are being timed and dont have the time to listen to long stories she might have said at the end im glad we could be of help dont hesitate to contact us again if blah blah blah i was actually waiting for her to ask is the vacuum plugged in now that mightve been rude customer was longwinded and boring and the rep helped him whats bad about that,negative
boring,negative
this is for orientation purposes at kirby,negative

you know this video makes me feel a lot better about myself re being a customer at a shipping store meant humorously like last year i had to do a lot of shipping and it was also a kind of rough time in my life so i was often very stressed when in the local fedex print and ship on top of generally being kinda weird in public because im autistic im also a bit of a neurotic mess who complains to themself while stressed so i was objectively a weird and maybe a mildly unpleasant customer but clearly i was far from the weirdest kind of customer out there,negative
customers are always right in matters of taste,negative

i dont get why people do this,negative

bingis,negative
stealing from a legit charity jar deserve to go to a special level in hell,negative
wow just wow,negative

people who come to the till on the phone are already so rude but this escalated,negative
bro said obviously like she can read minds,negative

is it me or she cried,negative
customer after hearing what the jar is for im a cancer on society close enough,negative
yeah americans,negative
it cant be that bad watches the video that pitchfork simply has to be around here somewhere,negative
it took me an extra seconds or so to realize he started with dollars then suddenly ganing cents realizing where it came from thats messed up its charity for a cause not for you sir even though you do seem like some sort of chsrity case but not one that deserves anyones time,negative
what is it with women and their questions what is it with you and your attitude,negative
am i the only one concerned about the tumor i know it is not dangerous at this stage but whattthopefully you are well and healthy,negative
i have a feeling this did not happen,negative
hey all you people who watched this if youre wandering why the nice ladybaker was so upset than you are probably a person everyone despites and in all for you seemingly awkward or nasty situations with other people youre the idiot whos wrong,negative
no one has seen fromscratchbakery in a bakery baking something from scratch right madeupvictimbakergirlcomplainsaboutherlifeandeverybodyaroundher,negative
i dont want to believe people like this exist but i know they do,negative
thats pretty low stealing from a charity jar,negative
that get out had the most passion from you ive seen yet,negative
the fucking audacity,negative
wow that was unreal,negative
when you hold out you hand only take what he took and then tell him to leave,negative
i dont know how you have so much patience id have kicked him out the second time he was rude stealing from a charity jar is low,negative
get out hell no you stay here i wanna dance ready the missile we gonna dance all night long buddy,negative
i worked as a waiter in a restaurant we were doing a charity event for a teenager on a wheelchair and the restaurant was fully booked a couple came up to me and asked if there was a table available and i said sorry but we are fully booked tonight you can other takeout if you want the lady just turned around and pointed at the table were the teenager on the wheelchair was collecting money and talking with the costumers about his story and asked me can we use that table i was a little bit blindedsided by her question so i told her that it was for the charity event but she just ask again if they could use it i just looked at her and said let me call my manager needless to say they left,negative
i was so happy and relieved to hear the assertive get out this is the most polite person on the planet if shes offended enough to say that to you you deserve it,negative
this is why the charity jar at my last job with one was a locking clear acrylic box with one of those braided wire things for like laptop locks and a second lock holding it to the counter only the store manager could open it and the cord was only long enough for the manager to reach to unlock it and put it in one of those deposit bags to be counted with another employee present and sent off to the charity we didnt have anyone try to steal it that i know of but we did have people ask if they could get change from it or use it as a takeapennyleaveapenny thing and we were like sir that money is for the children so they and their families can have clean water and food and you want to take from it for change if they bought something we could give them change back when the register opened obviously this usually made them realize what they just asked and if it didnt we would point to one of the pictures of one of the children and gesture to the bottle of filthy water and be like you want name to have to keep drinking this filth because you took money from himher they often got offended at the accusation and told us off really fun because it was often the store manager or another manager they were talking to and they would totally do the get out thing if it ever proved necessary but at least the next person in line or someone who overheard usually donated technically the business was meant to primarily funnel money to that and other charities so we didnt care about if they badmouthed us or anything we would likely just get more customers if they did,negative
im hoping that this is fake or in some way exaggerated because i still want to have some kind of faith in humanity but some people really are that awful,negative
the audacity the boot was justified people like that need to stay they ass inside,negative
i hope this was a joke short i dont like giving to charitys but id never steal from one,negative
ironically had he been polite she might have let him have it for,negative
wait wait no say ok that works take the money then tell him to get out or hell walk out with the coins he stole,negative
id pick the most expensive pastry if he cant be bothered to place an order then when he complained about the price id condescend to him and recommend something a little more in his budget,negative
bro is lucky he did not have the cops called on his ass,negative
im conflicted about liking this,negative
i really like your vds they are so peaceful,negative
on multiple occasions ive had people literally take our give a penny take a penny cups and empty them on the counter hoping to apply it to their purchase where the do these people come from,negative
taking money from tip jars charity pots and such is actually illegal and the person doing the theft can get jail time for it,negative
the audacity,negative
i felt her rage agreed,negative
you are so nice i would have made that guy a chalk outline,negative
i feel this my late grammy was diagnosed with a breast tumor at thankfully that didnt kill her or the ovarian cancer in her s or the lung tumor due to second hand smoke she died at strong lil old woman from montana,negative
omg i used to work at a pizza restaurant i asked a customer once if they wanted marinara or ranch with their cheese toast the woman screamed fcking ranch of course i hung up on her and walked away the manager answered the phone next and ended up standing there for minutes while this lady reemed him out for being hung up on afterwards he turned to us and asked did one of you hang up on someone everyone said no and he just sadly shook his head and walked away lol,negative
that briish accent xddd,negative
whispers very quietly get the fuck out before i beat you with whatever hot bread i have,negative
and thats why so many businesses have signs that read if you are on the phone you are not in line also what kind of monster steals from charity,negative
this horrible crap is why they have to make lock boxes for charitys people suck so hard,negative
had a diner like this a few days ago his phone kept ringing at the table and every time he would get so frustrated dude just mute your phone or turn it off,negative
oh dear no i had expected a oki skip the chocolate just have a coffee or such not this,negative
wow and i felt scummy having to use the charity jar to break a bill when my register ran out of quarters how do you ever think that is acceptable like just how the level of entitlement these people reach is actually just mind boggling,negative
seriously,negative
knuckle sandwich obviously would you like that here or take it to go,negative
well that was rude and disgusting,negative
what is with women and all their questions get out now,negative
seriously youre taking it out on the baker nobody needs to deal with people who are that rude besides everybody knows that youre bakery specialty is apple turnovers,negative
for a fresh pastry and coffee sounds like a steal to me,negative
seriously if you know youre going to order get off your phone its literally seconds,negative
isnt this basically a times worse version of her regular costumers,negative
wow the audacity of the man to touch the jar,negative
wait a charity for people who dont need it why not give it to cancer research,negative
id bounce a guy out just for holding up the line and continuing a cell phone conversation instead of ordering the rest is all just gravy,negative
correct response,negative
you see idiots feel they can do this in bakeries because they think there will be no consecuences if something like this were to happen in a restaurant then the head chef would step out of the kitchen with a body bag and the largest knife in their collection,negative
wait he stole the cents from the jar just like that,negative
there needs to be a job where people jettison these dumbasses i dont mean security like an acme engineer,negative
my mom had breast cancer and was on bed rest for around months that was a year ago and i am i would have done much worse than just say get out to him im so sorry you had a tumor and i love ur vids breastcancersurvivor,negative
why he going to a place that he allready thinks will scam him wait casinos exist,negative
ive seen people dig through tip jars to pay for their meal one lady did that at a restraunt while my mom and i were behind her and got yelled at by the line and she had the money to pay,negative
why no one is talking about breast tumoursshe said peoples like her,negative
i see that bmth hoodie ive got the same one,negative
get out was golden,negative
so donald trump walked into your store hey,negative
i never liked these type of people if they wouldnt move id shout at the person behind them what theyd like and if they try to order id ask nicly then shout the new questions,negative
is this real i wouldnt doubt it if it was,negative
obviously,negative
your shorts brighten up my day,negative
that was the most gentle expression of anger ive ever heard i wouldve been livid,negative
what is with woman and all their questions my good sir im gonna have to ask u to leave before i throw that obvious pastry to ur face,negative
would have sued here,negative
chocolate obviously oh sorry sir our mind reader isnt working today but our chip reader is so well be tacking on an extra euro for your snotty attitude,negative
you got brain tumor,negative
no but why isnt anyone talking about her tumor hey girly if youre reading this im really sorry to hear this you have always inspired me to become a young sweet baker and open my own bakery i cherish and love you so much get well soon darling,negative
i love the way she talks,negative
i put junk mail in a prepaid envelope from one of them and drop near my house i watch people pick up and open in case there is something they can steal there is a big note saying i am watching you steal,negative
im just kidding joking,negative
so do you own the bakery or do you manage it,negative
dude ive run the register at a fair booth for only years each year was i week and ive had so many people on their phone acting like that ive also had a guy clap in my face and act entitled just because he knew the owner,negative
so justified,negative
i almost disliked this video because you did such a good job portraying an asshole that i almost forgot this was a skit,negative
isnt that against the law as it is,negative
thats his problem hes american you know all americans are karens whether theyre male or female,negative
be kind but be aware,negative
i saw you in a supermarket one time,negative
shes so strong for only saying get out i would have started throwing hands,negative
women and all their questions dudes will literally turn around and unironically say god why do women want us to read their minds,negative
my aunt had breast cancer she cant have kids now has always wanted to than when she got married her first husband got mad at her cuz she couldnt have kids so they got devorcid sorry for my spelling im tired than she got married again and was finally accepted by a man for not being able to have kids im not going into to much detail cuz like i said before im tired,negative
i didnt see the jar and thought the guy payed cents for the jar as a form of payment if that makes sense rather than paying for the chocolate pastry,negative
and that one goes to the never serve list,negative
oh no i wouldve called the police on him,negative
get outtt was personal,negative
i very dearly love how we have our tip jar behind the counter where no one can reach it maybe we dont get as much as if they could just throw the money in there without a word but nobody can touch it and we dont have that stress,negative
this is why i cant work with the public play stupid games win stupid prizes,negative
please tell me this isnt based on truth would someone really do that,negative
i hope that person ho to jail,negative
if i had somebody to talk to me like that or even do that by the time the interaction was done ill probably end up in federal prison,negative
start me here we go middle fck him then end u sick bastard,negative
girl id have refused him service just for the dogshite attitude he was putting on youre a saint for letting him get far enough to show how big of a prick he really was willing to downright steal from charity for his own completely optional treat he doesnt even need or appreciate for that matter,negative
hes not wrong im a retail manager im not saving the world or curing any diseases with what i do but almost every day someone thanks me for taking the time to help them or give ideas even if we had nothing in the store in their size for them to purchase,negative
perfect,negative
brilliant example,negative
in a similar position with a travel company one guy was a tool towing the company line and giving me sass and can repeating no while saying he understood further poked an already aggravated customer the second was totally different he listened and said he would try and see what he could do i still dont have the outcome i want but i was less angry however this time they are actaul at fault,negative
well said,negative
good service yes great service is to tell the customer what action to take next,negative
i feel the same way i appreciate good customer service,negative
going extra mile to show that they matter,negative
basically show empathy,negative
to secret is to show care to everyone no matter there status,negative
so the secret is to show care and willingness to help,negative
empathy care and understanding overall is what i learnt from this thanks for this this example clearly explains how empathy should be demonstrated,negative
great example,negative
great customers service is what it feels like when somebody cares it doesnt mean we always get what we want but we get somebody who understands and cares about what we are trying to accomplish that is considered good service thank you mr sinek,negative
truly brilliant simon this video on customer service is another masterclass from you incredibly insightful and so accurately observed its always a pleasure to learn from your unique perspective,negative
its refreshing to be reminded that at the heart of great service is genuine human connection empowering employees to care makes all the difference,negative
you dont have that great of advice people do not need listen to you to be more effective and become smarter your part of a brainwash scheme,negative
great point,negative
well put,negative
there was one thing left out of the scenario i can get you on that flight but its at a significant cost because i cant apply the value of the ticket you currently have you would have to buy a oneway ticket to get home would you like me to research that for you,negative
exactly,negative
this video really challenges the old idea of customer service but lets be honestdont we often judge service by outcome not effort what do you think is genuine effort enough to be called great service even if we dont get what we want,negative
the problem is that service is not that important other factors such as price convenience or brand have more value if customer service was really that important many companies would be out of business,negative
damn that is a great example of hard selling the companys inadequate booking system at best it might make the customer lose interest and wonder off but it makes the clerk feel like a thief,negative
facts,negative
,negative
spot on i have to wonder though if there was availability on that earlier flight could the customer not just buy a ticket for it yes they would lose out the money spent on the later ticket but offering that maybe with a discount if i could would be my next course of action,negative
omg this is so me funny my manager doesnt like me being so helpful i get in trouble for doing the extra mile customers happy but not my manager haha,negative
this is really funny and ironic to me last week i was ghosted for a job interview i applied for a job the head of the department called me set up and interview for the next day minutes before my call they emailed to reschedule for the next day okay what time would you like to reschedule crickets the next morning i get a message can you do the call now sure what time that was the last i heard from them its been over a week the funny part is that i did exactly what simon explains here i went from really liking a company to actively hating it the ironic part is it was simon sineks company that ghosted me oh well,negative
listen to what the clients are saying how many mistakes that would prevent assumptions are not knowledge clients have to call and call and yell to get anything listen,negative
i would like the person on the phone but still hate the airline dumb policy should let me get a credit on existing ticket and buy a new one,negative
i think while people would be more appreciative if the answer was no after the rep tried versus not i think at the end of the day people do want what they want and thats really the only way for customers to have a positive association with a company,negative
pay the help enough to give damn,negative
refund the current ticket let him purchase the new ticket,negative
he could have called and bought a ticket for the earlier flight and taken it how much is it worth it to you to get to the wedding death bed funeral buy another ticket,negative
this is not feasible in every situation it depends on procedure and protocol that you have to follow and what type of company you work for period you can do and be that and if some people are miserable they will still react in a negative manner,negative
i have to know the clerk is being honest though and really tried,negative
you know whats not good service those canned responses that customer service agents are required to parrot whenever i call they say the right things but its canned its automatic its not real it makes whatever adverse reason i was calling in the first place worse oh and no im filling out your survey after the call and ill delete the email you send too,negative
sorry simon that does not satisfy me its making the whole thing sweeter but at the end the same happens over and over we all know by now whats going to happen this happens all the time with all kind of goods and services we buy it might have worked years ago but now it is the same old story we are lemons to be squeezed and customer service is just a pretense anyway i remain your fan,negative
when i talk to x company trying to get something i know when they are pretending to care about me it is always apparent to me,negative
the people on the front line did their best to help this man its too bad that those who designed and signed off on this system didnt take his somewhat common situation into account,negative
my american credit union wouldnt allow a close third party relative make a deposit to my account other expats told me they have no problem doing that they changed their mind after i complained to a state agency the company ceo,negative
lost my t mobile phone my very first day in mexico tried calling several toll free numbers with no success over several days retail stores in the us cant access your account information when i finally do get ahold of someone they cant access my account because the only way they have to do that is through the phone i lost been a customer for at least years wouldnt pause the monthly billing so i canceled the account and filed a complaint with the fcc they apparently think my account is on par with super power nuclear secrets what the football,negative
american customer service is awful companies do their best to avoid even talking to you now its infuriating,negative
so an customer fcing corporate should provide frontline staff with sufficient time to explore options on the customers behalf sorry simon youd not even get past linemanagement in most successful corporates after sadly the individual customer is no longer king only the rule appliesuntil it all comes crashing down and a new head of department starts the cyle all over again customer service is everything then performance tweaking kpis with max oncall time allowances further incremantal tightening rightsizing as staff resigns crash,negative
thank you simon your book start with why that i read around years ago has really resonated with me and thats how ive been building my brand and finding a lot of success with thank you d,negative
i stand by the airline staff they simply have no time to offer you stories after stories just to satisfy an arrogant customer,negative
camera quality from early s,negative
or you could just explain why you cant in the first place save the verbose and the bs i could be working in customer service too and see your bs coming from a mile away pun intended,negative
the problem is nowadays customers see through that bs and know the end answer will be the same because the agent is in a call center in another country and is truly unable to accommodate,negative
i never comment on videos but i have to say this is wrong ive worked in customer service for years the second scenerio makes sense but it only works if the customer is a logical somewhat intelligent person and if they are then they wouldnt be calling customer service they wouldve figured it out on their own a majority of the time its arrogant and egotistical where they would take that kind gesture and throw it back at you they see a kind weak person and try to dominate them into giving them what ever they want there are more psychopaths in the world then you would think there are,negative
omg you just described my new mechanic i trust him and love him because he cares,negative
as a salesperson for most of my life i can attest that this is the better way to go,negative
te operator knowed that his actions does do nothing with ticked why you feel this fake actions as a he cares about me,negative
stfu people are asholes and want the friction and theyre mad you know and dont tolerate them theyll ve back and keep trying too unlearn kissing people ass and being subservient it gets you walked on and killed they wont even see you in a positive light when you are regardless,negative
this approach is great after suffering on the phone for several minutes with a computerized voice before getting through to a human and typically the human can solve the problem quicker and better than the computer that answers the phone,negative
customer service means human service service of the heartserving the interests of others because it mattersim preaching to the choir apologies,negative
well said,negative
another huge issue with phone customer service is language barriers customers gets extremely frustrated immediately when they get a cs agent that they cannot understand who is talking to them from a far away country i really wish big corporations could understand this and not be so short sided to make it all about saving money on foreign call centers if i get an agent i cannot understand i hang up and call back until i get one i can understand better,negative
i truly agree with that that sometimes is so bad problem i notice thanks for the video,negative
mba thesis overseas outsourced customer service ignore or did not escalate customers billion dollar feedback as they lack the education intelligence to discern type of profitable feedback do not want to find more unnecessary work pay by the hour mindset and most importantly they are afraid of escalating feedback that results in their job loss pivotal point the customer service officer does not share in the profit male caucasian and china chinese nothing in it for me why bother mindset made by the company or male management that implemented the billion dollar feedback from a costbenefit perspective if the ceo is the customer service officer living from pay check to pay cheque what will he do,negative
incisive reveals what happens when humans conduct themselves like machines as machines do not see beyond the surface and flex we experience them as cold void of feeling however we expect humans to read situations relate and empathize to be warm herein lies the aspiration of ai inventors to combine the efficiency of a machine with the nuance ability of a human theres a lot in this video thank you for sharing this insight clearly,negative
this is spot on i worked call center cs for years and over that time i learned the problem is not really the reps its the company company decides what the call center does and since most companies dont really care then they put little effort into their call centers same is true of in person cs so when they hire they dont hire people who have the ability to do customer service they just hire bodies then they give them honestly weak training and send them on their way customer service is a trait it cant be taught people either have the ability to be good at customer service or they dont you can hone the skill of a rep but if they dont already want to provide the best outcome for customers then they will be mediocre at that job at best until they burnout or get fired and the company hires another seat filler and the cycle continues,negative
wording is everything,negative
customer service is emotional labor intellectuallogistical labor,negative
bringing seen by someone is incredibly powerful,negative
so does the customer service person need to actually speak to their supervisor and actually try to get the customer what they want or can they just pretend can it be like a welltrained actor performing a script,negative
always a wealth of knowledge mr sinek its sad that some things like this one for example are essentially stating something painfully obvious but the majority of people act like its the first time theyve heard it like a oooooh you have to care about the customer we never knew that lol the harsh reality though is that businesses have a habit of putting the most unempathetic individuals on their front lines facing customers which is also why its so easy to deal with a touchscreen terminal instead of a human because those humans have been dead inside for decades anyways for others to care about someone else they have to care about themselves first get the right people on the frontlines and then as a company take care of them as well,negative
its different between service and care service is given as per company sop but care is given as per srp we always dont say asap no even the customer is incorrect we handled it as per learn thanks for the suggestion simon,negative
every service person needs to hear this asap amazing difference in the delivery,negative
i work in customer service and wouldnt change it for the world nothing reasonable is ever a hard no there is always a way but give the customer a choice have them say no example given cancel the current tick and purchase a new ticket for the earlier flight the cost is x if the customer says no thats too much it then on them that said no customers like to be informed and anything that you said you would do is done when you throw in empathy it goes from good customer service to great simon is always on point,negative
care thats what great service means,negative
truth,negative
back in i was a bartender at a hotel in sf and the restaurant was shut down for a private party a lady came in exasperated from her late arrival due to flight issues and wanted a glass of wine the server immediately shut her down and told her no we were closed due to a private event all sales from the pos were tied to the event i said lets slow down i did explain explain to her while he was right that i felt her pain and gave her a glass of wine and told her it would be human of you to come back and pay tomorrow she did and on top of it tipped me poor customer service come from unqualified and poorly trained employees that server was more interested in acting like a boss instead of behaving like a manager,negative
i would be happier with a polite no given a logical reasoning than spending more time with a seemingly incompetent person for the same answer,negative

pov youre from ict,negative
nice job,negative
i really enjoyed this video i used it during a coaching session with my agents and they appreciated it lets say i have some claires lol what i appreciated most was how it highlighted that only a few small changes can significantly influence whether a customers experience is positive or negative,negative
thank you for this video kwestyon im preparing for nesting,negative
i am intimidated,negative
even though i agree claire made many mistakes lowkey she didnt deserved that treatment,negative
i wont lie at my old job i was claire but i got a new job and i want to be candace,negative
do you think tabithas sarcasm might be driven by the grinding monotony of consistently dreadful customer service pretty much nothing works well these days and running incredibly poor customer service operations is done deliberatey because its profitable until its made illegal were screwed,negative
fantastic information,negative
ispiritu ni candice sapian mo ako parati kung nakakagat dila ko kapag mabagal naman boses terminator daw ako wooh practice makes good kaunti pa,negative

i cant say enough how much your videos have aided me on my call center career journey im amazed at how much my calls have changed since i began to apply the knowledge you share here please know your work is very much appreciated,negative
thank you for the info,negative
i honestly just found you on social media recently but it wasnt until yesterday that i started watching your videos it is actually good timing because i was preparing for a job interview for this morning which i already finished i am confident to say that i did great and that i learned a lot of tips from you i live in the us and i applied for a job that will use a bit of customer service according to its description this is not the first time ive done an interview since ive had jobs before but what i picked up from your samples of mock calls etc is the confidence and the tone of the voice when answering questions i am a fluent english speaker but pinay here but if i were to compare my interviews in the past i didnt sound as confident as today because before i didnt wanna look or sound cocky to the interviewer also i was more nervous in the past haha but after watching your videos i now understand better that you can be confident without lookingsounding like a cocky candidate it also has something to do with my personality i guess because i am not mataray even if i try to be haha but i just wanna express how happy i am to have found you because your videos are very very useful not only for people who are in the call center business but for other careers as well if i were to come back to pinas i would definitely try to apply at a call center company i graduated in the phils with ab english course many years ago and i feel like this industry is where i belong i know there are virual asssistant jobscustomer service jobs here in the us but i havent ventured on those yet now im thinking maybe i should ill be watching more of your videos thank you,negative
hello what should we say if the other line said that the owner or accounts payable is not available or they are not in the office thank you so much in advance,negative
this is the scenario that im afraid for,negative
can defiantly relate to both parties when it comes to the most difficult calls but its always good to learn and develop from the negative calls you had to prepare yourself for future calls,negative
awesome thanks for the tips,negative
when a customer calls annoyed the first thing to do is apologize for the inconvenience and ask to give me a moment to see what i can do to get this matter corrected,negative
i feel like tabitha is nicer to candice than claire because tabitha is also you you decide her to be nicer than the other so i guess it be more convincing if you tried these with real customer as so we can see if theyd really react like this this is not a shade btw i love your vids just that i am a bit unconvinced with these would love to learn real technics from real conversation from a real customer,negative
muchas gracias,negative
wow simply wow this video is amazing the comparison between those calls just gave me a clearer view on what to do with my future calls thank you so much,negative
lovey videos,negative
hahaha whats dropshipping her intelligence is the size of a peanut i envy you missi know this a mock call but she shouldnt have to be accosted about a package she has no control over,negative

wow nice you look so professional in the way you are talking you making me so amaze with you it was so great to here your voice when it comes to question and aswer hoping someday that w this expirience like how you delivering your voice to answering in mock call thats great and so professional just wanted to be like you although im not that much so fluent in english but like the other said practice makes perfect but i dont know how and when it comes haha btw candice is great teamplayer as bpo agent she look nice when it comes to answering an irate customer thas so great on how the customer appreciated her from the start and at end of conversation i may have a round of a plauce to candice times,negative
omg thanks this video is just what i needed i mean sometimes you have good intentions but you just dont know how to proceed tyvm,negative
i loved it thanks alot,negative
among all videos here in youtube related to bad vs good customer service this is exactly how it looks like in a reallife scenario this is very informative and helpful i would recommend this to our leadership team,negative
who is claire,negative
this is a really helpful and realistic video this is my th month in this job and everything in this video is exactly like what happens in real life the way the costumer talks the way the advisors handle the call and also the query itself are all real,negative
hi i would like to thank you for share this video its so interesting i would like to ask you do you offer a english classes because i have experiences working as switchboard tlphone operator and i would like to reach and advanced english level,negative
hi kwestyon i just want to thank you for your blog that it helps me to land a job i have a permanent job right now thank you,negative
thank you for this im always looking to improve as a call center supervisor ive learned a lot of great terms from my co workers but these help tremendously in dealing with issues that have no answer or an answer guests dont like sounds like real life scenarios and talk instead of something that is too easy and doesnt help in tough real life situations,negative
all of your videos are great to watch they give me ideas and make the call handling seem an easy task to carry out congratulations on your channel,negative
thank you very much im on my second week of training and this helps me to see how to improve my call flow,negative
ratched,negative
tabitha is such a good and realistic representation of a customer on the line great stuff,negative

hi kwestyon i hope youre ok maam i have a really good question that made me in a jobs interview how would you tell a customer that you dont have the solution to his problem without making him angry i really appreciate your help ive not been hired yet,negative
hi shiena im a super fan of yours you make me motivated,negative
no stop being entitled and handle your business without emotions,negative
there are many karens in theses calls its frustefrustrating and annoying to deal with types of peoples,negative
blessings from colombia thanks for your channel,negative

if a customer at a cafe you managed mistakenly put a recyclable basket in the garbage and then apologized after you corrected them what would you say to him is there any chance you would add just dont let it happen again,negative
its my first experience working in a call center i think im the bad agent,negative
i love your videos because u hit everything on the head these are points that i always bring up during huddlesbut sadlya person can only do so much to help others right it would be entirely up to the agent if they want the help maybe u explain it better im gonna share this video instead,negative
i also encountered this kind of issue in my previous job as a call center agent you could really understand the customers situation they are calling about missing orders delays in the orders and incorrect items,negative
again you people are praising the customer and not the agent they are not machines hire robots or ai you clowns expect people to not act like people lol these types of jobs are way below my standards these customers dont deserve to be praised,negative
quien le paga a esta nena mil gracias ojal nunca te falte el alimento te quiero,negative

good video,negative
thank you maam i hope i can ace the mock interview,negative
i couldnt stop myself from watching nice content i learned a lot thank you so much miss,negative
thank you for the break down i initially didnt think she was so bad until the break down some customers do bring out the worst in your customer service,negative
yeah neither scenario would pass qa if you dont get all the info about the customer you failed the call and earned yourself a write up as soon as you start talking to the customer like they are a human you failed the call and have just earned yourself another write up dont upsell something write up lol i remember getting fired as a csr after taking a call where the caller said and i quote you literally sound more human than anyone i talk to on here they oughtta have more like you i got all three strikes on that one call the reasons i didnt ask for their contact info didnt pitch to make their next payment on the phone with em and i didnt sound professional this was at a credit card company and the caller just called to see why they got charged for going over their limit that was it didnt need to get their info for that i literally said looks like you went past your limit ill see if i take the charge off looks like i can so there you go bucks back on the card you should see it on your next statement or if you can check your transactions online if youre registered on that word of advice and i do this myself track what you spend on your card this way you dont get hit with that fee again because if you do im not sure you can get it taken off the next time it happens and that was it call took like a minute and a half where it could have dragged for like nine minutes if i wasted time trying to get their email phone number etc and like i said i made that dude damn happy probably cuz i put bucks back on his card but probably more so because i actually spoke with him like a human being the supervisors analysis a very deadpan even though you made the customer happy you didnt meet any of the quality standards we set for our agents and because this call was so poor today was your last day in this department i laughed so hard at that during my lunch hour that day someone in hr offered for me to move to a different department of the call center one where you just do paperwork all day i laughed at her too you learn no real skills in customer service other than some conflict resolution skills anyone working in customer service shouldnt go for telemarketing instead learn yourself some hard sales skills i mean no one should ever do that for any longer than id say six months but still way better than customer service especially if youre selling high ticket stuff that is actually useful but thats not easy to find haha oh and you can straight up hang up on the caller the second they utter a cuss word thats part of the rules in any given call center,negative
hi you gave me such wonderful idea with the agents assisting the same call they have a big difference thank you for sharing this kind of video specially for me as a newbie in bpo industry and having no experience at all this is a good help an da good tip for me god bless and keep on making us inspire,negative

the bad agent wears a black shirt has very messy hair has bad mannerisms and has particular movement showing theyre kinda irritated with the rant of the customer while the good agent wears a white shirt and tidy hair and shows focus and empathetic facial expressions i see what you did there good representation i also like the little fact you added to the end unfortunately its true being a customer service representative is not for all people especially if youre an introverted and hsp highly sensitive person this kind of work may not suitable for you it may burn you out unless youre in nonvoice then maybe you have a chance,negative
its way to call the problem with e mail or directly to tell it indeed it is no easy to solve more over as the costomer cerita must to klo every things if its happ emang suddenly but it must be faced although it beyond to solve difficulty it so sure can be found,negative
whats the best thing to say if a customer doesnt let you speak eg they complained about something but then they carry on speaking about their dissatisfaction for a bit too long and i want to politely cut them so that i can get to the main subject ie providing them solution or providing them clarification to explain that it wasnt fault on our side and that we did everything correct from our side secondly how do you respond to a customer who accuses you of ignoring them even though u didnt but you just couldnt respond to them due to having a large number of requests that came before that customers request and by the time those requests were fulfilled by you it was the end of your work shift so whats the best thing to say,negative
your videos are very helpful to me ate and im apply for a bpo company as of the moment and just waiting for the validation of my application and while waiting i am watching your videos omg this would much be a big help,negative

i actually had a roommate that would go into a rage until he was told he was talking with someone in the us whenever he called a customer service line hes dead now and everyone is happier he was a retired otr driver no surprise he married a woman and they had a child and then he discovered he was gay so he abandoned them and moved to west hollywood he was so full of lies and shiite it was amazing,negative
everyone involved is perfectly nuanced curious who wrote it but it doesnt even matter,negative

ladore,negative
what makes this so outstandingly beautiful is that its disguised as comedy when in all reality its one of the most breathtaking and deep concepts this was done surprisingly well,negative
whereismelania,negative
this was hauntingly beautiful the writing for this script reminds me a lot of the hbo show the white lotus anyone who liked this script would probably like that show it is raw sad relatable funny for brief moments and a little scary at others because of how relatable it is beautiful writing that is poignant and hit heart strings most shows or skits are afraid to go near well done snl i actually wonder if some of the writers of this skit were involved with that show,negative
sweet and sad such as life well dont skit,negative
wtf,negative
true fact the british burned the white house in because they found a spider in a bouquet,negative

tmuka love this video its so funny and great example of what not to do can i have your permission to use it in a presentation of what not to do in a presentation re customer service,negative
thanks for the montage the thing is they always portray the customer as the bad guy in real life i know there is a lot of compilations of customers being horrible but never taking about the representative being rude and is often portrayed as the victim who could never do wrong i know the customer isnt always right but neither is the representative either and yes ive worked in customer service ive had the most wrong be done to me mostly by my coworkers than customers customers are not the only ones that act rudely,negative
i can totally relate to the first video dont you hate it when theyre on the phone with like a relative or a friend instead of doing their job the sad part is this is now reality,negative
whats the movie with judge reinhold,negative
fast times at ridgemont high is so funny also this doesnt include the scene in big daddy where they asked for breakfast from mcdonalds at am when breakfast isnt served anymore but they wouldnt give it to them,negative
working in a retail store is enough customer service for a day,negative
honestly ive done customer service for years these peoples reactions to the way these customers are behaving is entirely why we sometimes behave the way we do there just comes a time whenever you get tired of being walked all over and being treated like youre beneath the dirt you walk on these people just took their zerofs left to give into the negative,negative
i know everyone is looking for the next bitcoin but thats like looking for the next wheel or the next internal combustion engine you can sit there on your porch and wait while were all buzzing by in our motor cars but even if you live to be a hundred you might not see another one,negative
estoy fumando mariguanaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,negative
yeah working at a rental car service seinfeld was being an ass if the company has a first come first serve policy then yeah hes shit out of luck the circumstances where it could have meant the cars needed to be maintained or anything he can still get a car but dont ever try to tell someone how to do their job or thinking you know more than us thats just being a bad customer all he had to do was ask when there would be a vehicle available and usually if the customer is nice they might upgrade it for free for the inconvenience but some customers feel they know what theyre talking about i feel every person on this planet should work a customer service job to see hear and feel how people talk to them like their shit and people wonder why we demand raises because some of you are just entitled assholes who think theyre right all the time,negative
anyone else here from tafe qld,negative
falling down is truly an incredible movie im glad i had to watch this for a homework assignment,negative

double baco for the cop,negative
we stopped serving breakfast,negative
gave i liter of cola,negative
double baco roger,negative
since im doing hospitality i started watching bad customer service and i started laughing because it was hilarious and i found out the guy from who played as a fire chief from tacoma fd ive seen all the time after the impractical jokers now hes a trooper or state police officer,negative
hollywood elitists pretending that they know anything about customer service,negative
the customer is always right was a foolish saying created by the idiots working corporate to try to increase profits no one has a right to mistreat an employee just because he or she is a customer and is paying money respect is a twoway street and biased videos like this are pure garbage,negative
how is the waitress from five easy pieces not here,negative
i got here from tescos,negative
if i learnt anything in my years of existance in this life its basically never i really mean never have a job revolving about providing a service im an md doctor i love studying medicine but the service part of my job is garabage at its finest im not trying to be condescending but a great majority of the people you serve are either idiots stubbern plain rude or low iqued,negative
i think you should be required to work customer service for a day then,negative
i dont get why stop serving breakfast is bad customer service i mean you put everything away and cleaned the oven its a pain in the ass to start serving again thats why they have the rule that they stop serving breakfast,negative
names of the movies please,negative
roger holding the spit,negative
neil,negative
roger holding the spit,negative
cringy af,negative

lol watch my new customer service rant,negative
the one about the pig is good customer service its karma,negative
rotflol,negative
some of our favorite examples of just horrendous customer service from some classic films thanks for putting this together tmuka and for censoring out the language that scene from planes trains and automobiles has quite a few fbombs,negative
whats the name of the clip with steve martin,negative
i always think of this when i have a shitty customer at work and wish i could just once say something like it to wipe the small of his face hahaha,negative
lol this is planes trains and automobiles with steve martin and john candy one of my favs still,negative
sandra why should be required to work in customer service so that they can understand what life is like to be a mentally handicapped mongoloid who is granted a job through some pitiful job placement agency,negative
which songs do you think are most special to richard branson,negative
i always know something funny is happening when i hear slap bass,negative
funny and very helpful,negative
i think everyone should be required to work customer service for a day lets see what happens,negative
personal calls at work are a major pet peeve of mine,negative
a bummer i was hoping to see the bit where steve martin freaks out on the car rental clerk oh well the jump from falling down back to seinfeld was pretty amusing,negative
thanks for the big laugh i just had,negative
share your customer service nightmare here comon nowwe all have them,negative
some of it is just shitty customers,negative
the best way to receive good customer service is by being a good customer,negative
check out my sleepytime vlog on my channel,negative
can anyone tell me the michael douglas movie it slipped my mind,negative
the one with the breakfast customer isnt bad customer service its just the customer being a douche l,negative
its a fantastic movie watched it several times john candy is incredible in it,negative
ah thats pretty inexcusable,negative
i forgot to mention that was her personal phone and it wasnt work related,negative
lots of places have bizarre protocol for phone calls for instance at my work management demands we pick up the phone within rings even if we are serving customers that actually took the time to come to our shop its been like that at the majority of jobs ive worked,negative
oddly enough where i live the dmv actually does a pretty good job at delivering customer service some are friendly and personable for an inner city understaffed government office at their worst they are just neutral,negative
thanks for bleeping the swear words i teach a customer service class and this would be a hilarious clip to show them thanks again,negative
you dont need to go far to see bad customer service just go to any government institution where they deal with the public like the dmv basically they dont owe you shit so they can do whatever they want i once came to the dmv waited in line for half an hour it was a very short line and as i approach the register ask my questions the phone rings the worker picks it up and just speaks with whomever for minutes while i stand there and look at her like an idiot,negative
it is exactly that it also star the great john candy awesome movie,negative
favorite episode of seinfeld,negative
,negative
i think its planes trains and automobiles,negative

i love that bit where basil attacks lord melberry with the chair and then gives manuel a completely underserved clout to the back of the head,negative
thank goodness i purchased the special edition dvd box set many years ago because the woke brigade at the bbc will make sure that it wont be repeated just like they did with another classic it aint alf hot mum,negative
what a shame cleese turned out to be such an arsehole,negative
good old days,negative
pc killed britain,negative
i practically know fawlty towers word for word and it still makes me laugh absolutely brilliance,negative
i wish you knew how much miss faulty towers i russel have seen it so many times and cant find to watch it again only the clips we love faulty towers,negative
basil was actually being nice to the lad at and let a few of his insults slide until the boy just kept pushing him,negative
guess what i was just in london and they have a fawlty towers play thats terrific and just like the show the actors resembled these too when basil did the german walk with his long legs the audience laughed and clapped,negative
why cant the average brit get rid of the bbc management surely they answer to govt get the right wing in there,negative
certainly one of the very best comedies ever brilliant acting by all concerned and fabulous storylines real british comedy that the do gooders probably would not allow now sadly rip to all who took part but are no longer with us,negative
it was a hate show,negative
what a shame no one got the balls to make programs like that any more,negative
the longer i work in hospitality the more i enjoy basil fawlty,negative
wish they would put this back on tv,negative
thats torquay out that window lol the last time i checked reviews of hotels in torquay guests were complaining of looking out their windows to see people injecting themselves in a neary carpark apparantly its a really bad place because of drugs now,negative

she is exactly like an old school teacher i had ugh,negative
this and only fools and horses are classics,negative
cliche an expression idea or action that has been overused to the point of seeming worn out stale ineffective or meaningless the prevalent communication tool of yt users who probably believe they have said something extremely original or never heard before,negative
we did not start it yes you did you invaded poland,negative

happy th birthday john october,negative
definitely the greatest comedy of the th century and beyond seinfeld falls to second,negative
fantastina serija,negative
i was a manager manager of a restaurant for years ive got to admit by the last year i worked there i was a lot like this guy the i loved the the restaurant i just hated and despised the customers and a fair number of the staff too who seem to think it was somehow my fault that most of the customers were creepy frighteningly ugly stinking rude degenerates and alcoholics stupid mean potentially violent drunks while the corporation that owned the restaurant was mostly only concerned about was that the the lying thieving creepy frighteningly ugly stupid stinking degenerate potentially violent alcoholic drunks paid for their drinks and they were happy enough to come back soon to give us more of their sweaty nasty bad smelling money,negative

wizzard with a tin opener has a pullizter prize for it,negative
this series is so denselypacked with great dialogue and situations that the whole thing is virtually a highlight i remember the producer i think it was in a documentary explaining that the scripts for the episodes were far longer than those for other half hour sitcoms,negative
basil shows his creative side when he improvises the whole sarcastic story about the chefs skill with a bottle of salad cream and a tin opener wonderful,negative
perfection refreshing and hilarious,negative
wheres the drug test trumps eyes are bouncing around like crazy biden did enough to be honest his life is a story that you would want your kids to read aboutthe other guy his story is latched to greed and ego friend of epstein and child traffickers trump would sacrifice all his followers for a buck thats all he asks for more money if you would trust trump to be alone with your daughter or wife motheryou would be beat by the devil,negative

amenand god save bbc,negative
yah know i used to have a french teacher just like him back in the day he terrified us kids in the class but looking back now i can see just how hilarious he actually was,negative
as ive got older i treat life like basildon years ago nearly today society sadly is lacking someone like bas,negative
posting videos like this is exactly how nazi germany started,negative
this is how i deal with them idc i dont deal with bs hello hello caller if you can hear me please call back at fuck off only i give out real then say thank you if the tone changes sometimes they say sorry then i can magically hear them again,negative
this is what actually needed,negative
if only this is possible,negative
relate much,negative
same feelings bruh,negative
that was the only correct way to deal with it,negative
the perfect loop doesn nvrmd,negative
this is reality,negative
sweet,negative
i have to deal with rude members all day thank you for this,negative
this is not how we deal with customers or if you do you will get fired if you dont then it tells a lot about the companys ethics therere protocols on how to calm down angry customers if they dont listen for the rd warning then you can maybe hang up or quit also a valuable customer service dont just copypastes website information that theyve probably found themselves if a company teaches that to its employees then it doesnt live up to customer satisfaction a good customer service rep listens and doesnt assume that the customer is stupid which involves not repeating the same things over and over again just because their hands are tied even if theyre new to the role or at an entry level position they should be able to reach out to higher level support teams or at least escalate the problem for better customer satisfaction also i dont think that a customer who begins this angry contacts the support team for the first time it is more likely that he hadnt been served despite numerous attempts waiting in unreasonably high queues only to get told some generic answer again and again no wonder he is pissed,negative
sighs in customer service wow ive never felt anything more relatable,negative
ask him to speak to a supervisor is rude make sense why you have to deal with incompetent people like this,negative
im cracking up imma do this to protect my peace moving forward,negative
i used to tell customers their behavior was unacceptable and put them on hold seconds the first time secondsit never went to i wondered at them not hanging up and calling back but they never did they would either be polite or in some occasions apologize it gave me the opportunity to take a breath as well,negative
im still confused as to why anyone would think someone is going to tolerate that type of tone in say what u want about gen z but imho they are the most respectful over the phone ill let you guess who has to be taught a lesson lol,negative
if only we werent monitored every call every dial and move lol i just put them on speaker so they are not screaming in my ear i mute the phone and let them rant and then transfer they dont get my attention not like that,negative
its very hard being dumped on,negative
im thankful to have seen this today it honestly cheered me up thank you rude costumers are constantly harassing people and then on top of that the employee gets talked down on by theyre managers its bs and i really dont know how those people can sleep at night with their negative souls and hearts but the nice costumers freakin appreciate them so much fr,negative
lol but wait no customer service person is nearly as good wyou wyour brilliant cat dogs ones but sometimes you gotta get a supervisor on the phone asap bcuz ive been cut off times already being polite especially bcuz the automated answering system has no choice and if the end of his sentence because if i dont ends in i dont get the insurance info confirmation on my dog who has been hit by a car the vet wont take the dog and besides this constant awful ringing and and perhaps righteously angry consumer is way way more annoying to you than just letting a supervisor on the phone asap not one of your better thinks of everything like when you talk wbubba rudeness may be fear danger or maybe theyve just had as bad a day wyour company as when you have had that kind of day and your favorite word is just fuck i love the dog call when his parents are slightly off regular feeding time and you are so so so so sweet and understanding and this one or a similar one ends by you making dog put the inattentive parents on the phone and you lay down the law re who is most important,negative
omg this what i want to do everyday,negative
wont you get fired for this,negative
god i wish i could do that,negative
except that you re gonna have to wait until they curse at you to hung up the phone otherwise it would be problematic,negative
ive done that before,negative
this is hilarious but if i did that at my job id get written up but it would feel so good to be able to do this just once,negative
my man,negative
im guilty of doing this,negative
that was very therapeutic thank you,negative
i think im gonna quit my job after a year of insurance customer service work literally made me bipolar,negative
no that will get you fired,negative
hearing that phone rings making me anxious and exactly sigh at the same time with him i worked in a call center before and i hope i will never gonna be back to that vile job ever again,negative
oh my goodness i did the same thing when i used to work in customer service,negative
ive been yelled at hit on and cussed out over the phone working at a call center never again,negative
the way i kept watching it but then i realized it was a loop,negative
,negative
when i went to mcdonalds and i saw someone smoking weed while making my food i definitely wouldve called like this if i had the opportunity,negative
bloody managers come back at you asking why you did so really,negative
every time i do this they call until you answer and were not allowed to block numbers,negative
i would go crazy if i had to do that job,negative
nope,negative
how many of you realized that youve been watching it or times,negative
love it when i get a customer who calls in has of international charges and the first words put of their mouth is hi stfu and only speak when i tell you too do you understand yeah thats not how ot works best are the weirdo people who call in crying because wahhhhhh even though i had auto pay on you didnt ask for my permission and took my rent for the month im on welfare and this is illegal tell them ok let me see if we can refund a charge you legally agreed to they get happy then you drop the news yp them and you tet the great crying while talking not accepting responsibolgiy of their actions,negative
it happens to me all the time,negative
sorry,negative
i have worked in call center customer service and i love how the guy smilesgrins before answering call because that is exactly what we are instructed to do supposedly our smile comes through pleasantly over the line,negative
thats so me my boss says i just dont give a f about angry customers im like yup i had enough and i dont want more,negative
sometimes i wish i can just do this,negative
i wish i could do that,negative
lol dying,negative
if they want the supervisor they better ask nicely,negative
ive been going through your videos my man you are gfted you are also batshit crazy but a gifted whackjob,negative
it took me to the second time to realize it looped xd i usually let my phone ring until the last few possible rings to answer because it gives them a chance to hang up before i answer but ive had calls where ive answered to expletives and they get one excuse me i will end this call and further swearing gets the hang up,negative
i do the same when the cussing starts,negative
that nope is so cathartic that i felt better just hearing it,negative
the sigh has said it all also hanging up like that would also give me anxiety youre brave,negative
oh my god that breath right when it calls is coming in like oh here we go,negative
something thats impossible to do,negative
what a loop,negative
pretty good loop tbh,negative
smiling before answering like they can see you lol,negative
didnt even realized this had looped until like the third time lol,negative
ahh a great way to get fired for call avoidance haha,negative
and then you just claim the call got cut off cuz the tech always broken anyway like lmao prove me wrong,negative
wayyy to good of a loop,negative
i also take a deep breath bfr calls esp when it is busy,negative
i now understand why my mother came home from work angry csa employees and anyone that deals with this over the phone work it is draining not the work but the idiots and self entitled assholes that chip away at ur patience i understand now,negative
the immediate fake smile of here we go again,negative
call avoidance getting fired managers can see when you hang up on customers,negative
phone work hack hang up while you are talking so it seems like the call was disconnected no one expects that you would hang up on yourself,negative
i wish,negative
if i do it tho at my workplace ill be fired,negative
this is a great way to get fired,negative
at least yours rings ours just auto answers,negative
i literally do this lol,negative
this is why call centers are outsourcing to indians do your fucking job oh waaaa my job is so hard to talk on the phone panzy,negative
i was the only one logged in on a saturday and this person kept trying to get a supervisor but wouldnt agree to the callback so i eventually just answered saying i was the only person taking calls and she stopped after that,negative
so glad my phone stuff is internal abuse gets escelated to my manager who escelates to the abusers manager and hr the threat of that keeps people civil,negative
i hate when i get these calls,negative
it should be mandatory to work a service job for year before graduating and becoming an adult it would solve alot of bullshit and lets people see how fucking stupid other people are,negative
as someone has to deal with customers on the phone i can relate to this,negative
yes,negative
damn who recorded me and uploaded it,negative
i literally just had this call,negative
this was much needed today after constant abuse from customers,negative
facts,negative
sighs in customers service i fuckin felt that i work in foodservice and a well whatever they need but usually cashier and server becuase im one of the best at controlling my voice and expression and god some people like i have people come in and snap at me for not bringing them shit they didnt ask for wheres my ketchup bitch you said you didnt want any when i asked fucking seconds ago,negative
the loop,negative
extremely underrated,negative
and thats how you lose your job,negative
eyy i also have a p pro,negative

the transition was so smooth,negative
walmart employees in a nutshell,negative
this is actually how customer service is today,negative
slegg or stratco sadly this is what stratco has become what used to be fantastic store is now not worth going to,negative
this has to be walmart,negative
it is a do it yourself store,negative
not her typing on that dusty ass keyboard tho,negative
try that now its worst,negative
im sure people die in phone ques waiting for anyone to handle their inquiryespecially bank phone cues ever been given the run around by customer service staff who clearly couldnt give a toss their goal seems to be just how many customers they can annoy daily one time customer service was much more than merely words staff genuinely helped customers gained huge personal satisfaction from doing so no this is absolutely true i really miss those days what we endure now is as far as you can get from that ideal this would all change if ceo salaries bonuses were tied to how well the customers were serviced as determined by those surveys some get us to do i can only dream,negative
no questioni luv this vid,negative
probably every employees acted shit here because of their manager or boss does the same to them,negative
excellent you have to greet them they assume that you know they dont help you get it in short theyre doing you a favor to answer your question then back to their phonesocial media he did the right thing taking his business elsewhere and reporting it on social media since thats where todays generation lives and the only place that they respond conversely whenever one gets good customer service basically the opposite of this report that as well,negative
country buffet guy could surely teach these employees a thing or two,negative
to be honest it is hard enough to do our job we also have to escort the customer to the bread isle when there is a huge sign that says bread,negative
i would have stayed demanding a manager and that poor manager would have needed a vest shield and ear muffs,negative
my mom acts like a karen during very bad cs,negative
i kinda feel bad for brody,negative
we all have been there the customer service cant help not knowledgeable and quotes company policy so they dont have to find a solution,negative

reminds me of walmart and mcdonalds i always get better service at heb and brookshire brothers here in texas,negative
customer service delivers memory and experience to customer so its with emotional angle and subject expertise angle if you dont have this skill then confess and improve in it with pure heart,negative
the next day boss hi good morning sir id like to apologize what happened during your st time at sluggs lumber ill address this to my staff about why this happened rudeness is very unacceptable and we expect every customer to have good experience with us i completely understand if you choose not to return but if you do im sure youll have a better experience again im very sorry about what happened and ill address this to my staff immediately thanks for bringing this to my attention i saw you told a friend and your friend addressed this to me feel free to call the store if you have anymore questions thank you and have a good day,negative

whenever i see a customer i always try to ask how they are and ask if they need help or something anything but sadly i go elsewhere and never hear anything no one asks how are you when you are near the employee and they dont care great training and dont bother complaining to customer service because they wont give a shit,negative
so hes basically in wal mart,negative
this video is true facts nothing was exagerrated here,negative
ive worked in customer service for years customer service is really customer servant its slavery overworked and underpaid as long as workers are nice to me im nice to them i dont bother anybody if i dont like the service i just go to a new place simple,negative

your employees are behaving this way because theyre tired of dealing with jerk customers all day and because you refuse to post a no customer abuse will be tolerated sign on the door while the occasional nice person like this gentleman comes in the employees are already dealing with ptsd from every other customer that day and will avoid speaking to anyone if they can help it customers may not like the service they receive anymore but theyve brought it upon themselves and im not apologizing to any of them,negative
lol,negative
the one rep who admitted it was a mistake was prob fired the next day,negative

im usually on the side of the customer service person but that first person was a fucking idiot like who looks at that bill and doesnt even try to get a supervisor or what have you like what the hell,negative
they should have fired the first rep,negative
part of me has to wonder what the company culture is like at the call center she was contacting some of them are extraordinarily toxic and wont allow their employees to deviate from prescripted talking points even if all they do is change one word on the script might be different in europe but in the us there are call centers that will happily fire a dozen people a week for tiny things like that because they know they can always hire more people who are desperate enough to put up with it,negative
fire the customer representatives obviously theyre inept to say the least how much quadrillion dollars,negative

the tower of babel happened because of the dr light incident the thing is that unfortunately the jla members that were effected by the tower of babel were those that had nothing to do with batman getting lobotomized even more unfortunate was that the man who stole those contingencies and went to town with them was the man batman thought he could trust just as much as the jla,negative
i mean i dont really have much sympathy for dr light tbh he raped a woman and basically said if he gets locked up hell break out and do it the fuck again was lobotomization extreme yes but he had attacked their family and they felt like they were backed against a wall,negative
they went pretty soft on light,negative
people love batmans plans from tower of babel they either dont know or forget how stupid the rest of the story is,negative
what i love about this moment is how it plays into batmans character arc leading into infinite crisis the tower of babel incident showed that batman was indeed pragmatic to a fault and willing to be unhanded for the greater good but that could be brushed off as simply batman being cautious and even justifiable half the league even agrees with him to an extent however batman remembering the mind wipe sends him spiraling because at the end of the day batmans greatest asset in a world of superhumans is his mind yet zatanna was able to overcome even that with a few words on the surface batmans contingencies are simply him being practical and realistic however underneath the surface they are also manifestations of batmans growing paranoia and need for control batmans actions during this time the contingencies brother eye pushing the league away even rejoining the outsiders with himself as leader despite having left the group for years are all him trying to regain some semblance of control and power because after all the last time bruce was powerless and had no control he had to watch as his parents die still he loses control anyway ras steals his plans and nearly kills the league the outsiders fall apart maxwell lord steals brother eye and suddenly the biggest threat to humanity was created by batman then we come to infinite crisis where batman spends much of the event helpless to do anything supervillains are running wild in the streets omacs are hunting down superhumans and the amazons bludhaven was nuked and as the cherry on top reality itself was being ripped apart by alexander luthor and superboy prime sure batman led the operation to destroy brother i but freaking booster gold had to do the initial legwork to figure how they could even find it and track down the key to doing so jaime reyes then everything comes to a head for batman during the battle for metropolis when nightwing took a shot meant for bruce dick had been bruces last bit of hope in the world and when bruce thought he lost his first son he broke he needed control he needed to feel like he could do something to bring order in this world that now felt so far beyond him he couldnt do anything to stop the real threat a rampaging superboy prime but he could pick up a gun and shoot alexander luthor for causing all this so thats what he does batman attempts to kill a man not because it was the only option or even because he was defending another he betrayed everything he stood for because he was scared and angry and desperately wanted to feel in control again its a shame that the only takeaway from tower of babel was prep time beats everything because the best thing about the story is how it fits into this longer story arc of how bruce wayne was brought to his lowest point however noble bruces intentions and however understandable his motivations were at the start his paranoia sent him spiraling he never got the control he so desperately sought and the pursuit of it broke him in the end its some great character work to watch and im always a little disappointed it doesnt get talked about more,negative
in a way if ya want to stretch it this incident helped pave the way for ted cords death,negative
identity crisis gets a lot of flack for fridging and out of character decisions but i still wanna read it cause hearing about the justice league procedure and menutia sounds facinating,negative
i think batman was perfectly rational in this situation did doctor light deserve this yes he did but the idea that the leauge would do this more than once they needed to be stopped,negative
he suspected they did the same to catwoman after this and the fact they did and did it twice is so sad shes left wondering if her changing was of her own choice or cause something was removed that made hee who she was or that she didnt need but had no choice in removing it,negative
tale as old as time lesser leaguers screw bruce over so he becomes paranoid tower of babelomac and brother eye something happens due to his paranoia league blames bruce maybe if the rest of the league stops screwing over bruce then shit like brother eye wouldnt happen,negative
bull fucking shit batman wasnt involved in the cleanup and where villains went to prison,negative
so im not getting into the batman mind wipe my question is how would you all handle dr light if mindwiping and personality is a no go also im just noting that the specter just sent him to the gulag and was done with it,negative
i cant really feel sympathy for dr light but for batman i can only imagine the betrayal he probably felt seeing zatana look him in the eyes while she essentially forcefully altered his mind,negative
for people who cannot read the reason they wiped batmans memeories was because he was being combative and stubborn and everyone wants to glaze him for his preparation so obviously id mind wipe him too as for light its ironic the irreparable damage he did to someone else was done to him yet thats seen as evil,negative
batman pulls funding green arrowaquaman shit now i got to pay for everything,negative
i still cant understand how people say batmans in the wrong for having the contingency plans or not trusting anyone after this shit,negative
to all the people who keep bringing up batman brainwashing jason you do realize this happens years later after this comic right he didnt do any of that in identity crisis plus zurenarrh was influencing him the justice league wiped his mind solely because the decision to justify lobotomizing a villain was inconvenient these situations are completely different stop comparing them,negative
batman was in the right to create his jl contingency plans and this solidifies it,negative
seems harsh batman invests heavily in the recovery of villians,negative
the first sentance was said so causally lmao,negative
this is the justice lords all over again,negative
anyone else see how huge hawkmans eyes were,negative
is there a graphic novel i can buy to read the whole story,negative
why is the justice league handing out sentences this is for the courts to decide no are they judge jury and executioner,negative
still think dr light deserved that ngl,negative
i mean dr light is a rpist im pretty sure sooooooo a lobotomy is a kindness in my book,negative
getting pretty tired of batmans high horse and moral pussitude dr light got what he deserved end of story chastising zatanna for brainwashing dr light into no longer being a villain is straight up devils advocate whataboutism batman acting like an opp here the writers have no idea wtf they doing,negative
i find it hard to believe that superman or batman wouldnt help with the cleanup,negative
horrible,negative
lmao this is what the no kill rule does to anmf or in this case the a team members of the league you have someone like dr light who by all means should get the death sentence but thats a no no so you lobotomize him which ill be honest i dont care at all he deserves it but then batman comes is at it goes fubar funny or rarher unfunny thing afeter this dr light somehow learns about it and decides to take revenge by attacking the teen titans mf eventually gets killed by someone who doesnt care for the no kill rule and got sent to literal comic hell,negative
i call bs on bats never being there for cleanup hes always been one try to make sure that the criminals are sorted properly and the families are taken care of sounds like ollie and the others were jaded because they didnt personally feel as valuable what light did was unforgivable but erasing his mind and wiping bruces memory of the incident crosses so many ethical lines,negative
batman has not been the most likable or trustworthy character in recent years so its hard for me to disagree with the league here,negative
identity assassinating a villain is one thing but trying to brainwash a fellow leaguer batman to cover that is an entirely different thing to me it crossed the line so hard it reminds me of the young justice show where miss martian did this to superboy huge no,negative
this is the kind of thing the question would have a field day with,negative
tower of bable takes place before this story,negative
didnt agree with batman here what were they supposed to do let a crazed supervillain who knows their secret identities go out and possibly tell others he lives in such a fantasy world look what happened to jim and barbara to jason batman is really an asshole of a character who has the stupid standards but the only reason he can live with them is because hes alone most of the time he doesnt have that many people who are civilians in his life hes able to have a devil may care approach to things to be honest ralph could have killed light and literally pled temporary insanity due to crime of passion i guarantee you nobody would vote guilty batman of course would be upset but then we could just get hal to punch him in the face again,negative
i know its been done several times but we need a team of heroes thats okay with doing things like mind wiping villains a team that will stay long term,negative
this storyline is so similar to squadron supreme mini series back in s it was actually marvels first civil war except in alternate universe funny how squadron was copycat team but this story copied theirs,negative
interesting got any issues that artwork in the beginning is nice,negative
im actually with zatanna on this one batman may have beaten the villain but how do you contain someone whos incorrigible answer you kill them or lobotomize him which is the same as killing,negative
that would end my trust in them too not just the group but the people involved never again messing with someones mind like this is so messed up on a fundamental level something like this dose make you look at his backup plans for the group and agree,negative
this was just a disgusting story as a whole what followed and was included was interesting but the idea of dr lighta villain mostly known for fighting a group of teenagers doing this and the way it was revealed and the situation around it being revealed was just insanely stupid pretty much entirely relies on the idea that some of the smartest people in the entire dc universe couldnt figure out how sue was killed and the idea of not only fridging her but retroactively revealing she was the victim of something that horrible and no one mentioned it for years feels really gross and deathstrokes ability to beat the entire justice league is so goddamn stupid i dont care how much the writers love slade if he could always overpower the will of kyle rayner he wouldve gotten a ring years ago sorry thats a bit of a rant i just feel like this story is not one that we should be giving retroactive appraisal its a lot like dcs version of civil war a story thats sort of a postdark age attempt to engage with that method of storytelling with a st century modernism and like civil war its also really heavy on shock while light on substance ill say though we can definitely look at the great stories that followed as only possible because someone took the plunge to see how far they could go doesnt mean that they ended up coming back up for air but still,negative
cadmus had every reason to exist,negative
you all sit there and complain about how all batman does is imprison his villains and they keep escaping what is he really doing he should just kill them when the jl does exactly what you guys ask for you guys judge them and not try to understand you arent them you arent going through what they are going through dealing with what they have to deal with mentally physically and emotionally,negative
okay i get that dr light did something terrible but mindwiping batman a friend and the guy providing your funding im supporting the complete dismantling of the justice league at this point,negative
this is why batman has project omega in case of a thing like this,negative
dayum,negative
nah the tower of babel is still very much that bad like you said the likes of batman were rarely there for the cleanup or logistics of what to do with villains so he doesnt really get to judge from a moral high ground about how others handle it he only showed up in that particular instance because of personal connections not as a matter of course for every victim the rest of the league were doing the best they could with a bad situation does that justify their actions or make it right not even a little was batman justified in losing faith in the league absolutely but taking that loss in faith and using it as justification to put the faith they had in him confided in him asking probing questions and looking at all of them as enemies collectively planning to use their traumas and weaknesses to hurtkill them batman is just as dirty as they are he has no moral high ground here,negative
if dr light had committed some other crime maybe i would understand batman but really i dont see an issue hes lucky the league didnt just execute him like they should have,negative
you all be wild many of you complained for a lobotomized drlight hed be lucky he wasnt tortured vivisectioned and castrated all while being kept awakened wothout anesthesia sure the fact that they did it to batman was bad but wtf was batman complaining about hes to much of a puss to do it to villains but when it comes to the justice league its ok fk batman and his superior morality,negative
to say batman was never there for the clean up is wild my man is constantly scrubbing records and cleaning up after them on a global scale the least they can do is handle the immediate cleanup,negative
batman flew into a rage bcuz hes mad that they lobotomized a grapist his narcissism knows no bounds batman has no problem sacrificing innocent lives to maintain his own twisted sense of morality other peoples lives arent as important to him as he is to himself everybody skips over the narcissistic and psycopathic nature of what it means for batman to let murderers go on living just to do it again later hes basically saying me and my morality is what is most important to me and ill sacrifice innocent lives to maintain it,negative
yet famboys would say batman should never have a contingency plan for tge league this is why,negative
the guy who wrote this controversial story was a moron he literally thought that the bronze age of dc comics was the silver age im not even joking look it up,negative
people get upset at batman for having contingencies when shit like this happens,negative
the th and th amendments exist to the people suggesting they were right to do that to dr light no they werent objectively speaking they were violating american law under whose jurisdiction the sentencing of dr light would fall so theres no moral argument to be had america already decided the answer to the debate during its inception,negative
the justice league decided to do what,negative
this was the first comic i had read in over years i loved it and never quite got the hate that it got,negative
whats the name of the series,negative
makes paranoid characters like amanda waller not seem so paranoid this is definitely a slippery slope,negative
batman would have no issue mindwiping villains as long as he is the one making the decision to do so i have no issue with mindwiping villains especially when the discover a secret identity lobotomizing dr light was pure vengeance though batman is right to be angry about the fact that they mindwiped him he is a hypocrite for being against mindwiping villains,negative
man these writers have no idea what characters they are writing for they just want to create drama and find some sort of storyline to sell copies this is why i dont invest myself in these stories,negative
the league admits they have done this dozens of times but only ever to erase villains knowing their secret identities light was when they went to far and tried altering his personality,negative
that hawk man mask is scary asf,negative
uhhhh yeah this is kind of an insanely evil thing for the justice league to do,negative
well yeah batman needs his villians tobstay alive and healthy so he can continue to play hero,negative
while tower of babel is messed up until you realize how op everyone is it isnt justified dont get me wrong being a little bit more cruel with how he would stop them is pretty smart,negative
and then he turned around and lobotomized jason smh,negative
oh boo hoo batman has contigency files on everyone friend or foe as if that wasnt enough to be offended but when a contigency plan is used on him he and superbaby have hissy fits because it wasnt their idea,negative
they said its am,negative
dont mess with the bat or the bat will mess with you,negative
source,negative
batman is an arrogant self righteous scumbag he never wanted justice he suffers from a mental sickness hence why he allows joker to escape all the time he secretly wants him to escape because he is trapped in a inescapable battle thats why he fights all the way into the future ie batman beyond he secretly doesnt want a conclusionsolution his not a hero his screwed in the head ps how is locking people up in prison and taking away their freedom any better then death or lobotomy infact id say its worse,negative
weird how when you circumvent and assault the most logical and analytical part of the justice league aka batman theres consequences who couldve seen that coming oh yeah everyone,negative
we gonna ignore hawmans big ass eye,negative
batman not thinking what happen with people that he beat up is only reason why people in gotham are constantly murdered by the same criminals,negative
sounds like average discord drama tbh,negative
batman doesnt need to be there hes batman,negative
we all know the only thing batman cares about is the protection and welfare of murdering criminals like his beloved joker,negative
glad batman backed out fuck the justice league but how exactly was this justice league inside a justice league slip past batman,negative
yeah i dont even agree with green arrow on batman and sups not being their for the clean up both of them would hover over things and help even before hyper paranoid batman he would be there sounds more like hal and the rest just didnt agree with helping the baddies and wanted to have them sent up river and forgotten as bad as arkham is it was made to help people it failing is more a reflection on it then batman sending folks there,negative
dr light not only sad sue dibny he bragged that he would tell all the villains and even made hard light constructs showing him grading sue in very graphic detail he deserved worse,negative
they lobotomized dr light dang whos gonna fix the robot masters now j,negative
i sort of find it out of character for batman to just ignore the aftermath of what happens to defeated villains,negative
but i understand everyones choice in that superman and batman hold a holier then thou attitude but the little people always suffer for it those people made a necessary decision for the people,negative
batman did nothing wrong but the jl oh man smfh they essentially let the punishment fit the crime and literally mrd the guy and then did it to bats they committed very heinous acts more so imo,negative
batman didnt have prep fir this one,negative
when the wait staff tries to tell the kitchen staff how to do their job,negative
it was wrong on so many levels like how professor x from marvel loved to pull that nonsense too,negative
guess thats why he had thise contingency plans or whatever its called against the justice league,negative
this guy sucks,negative
i dont care what they say about dr light his sa of sue dibny was one of the best sub plots in the history of comics and the reason why i say that is because it opens up so many possibilities it caused batman to leave the justice league it caused superman to leave and it bought up the question what do we do with super villains who attack our loved ones which is something comics had never really tackled before it really was an interesting premise but i dont think readers were ready for it at the time,negative
did batman have an actual plan or was it just this bad cause i said so you cant exactly let someone who can sell your family out to killers walk free and you sure as hell cant turn him over to the government who has been looking for ways to control the heroes for decades,negative
i love how its always the flash who does the right thing,negative
is it me or batman punching hawkman who has considerable durability okay,negative
i despised a lot of this series it had some highs but some awful awful lows,negative
dang some heroes to go after batman too,negative
is the reason that superman and batman arent usually involved in the clean up because of their whole secret identities thing like superman has to go back to being clark kent quick and batman has to go back to being bruce,negative
its also kind of wild to think that dr light appeared on the teen titans show that guy appearing on a show for children,negative
maybe everyone is tired of batman punching a villain then fucking off to be a billionaire playboy while they have to deal with the fallout until inevitably the villain comes back kills some innocents only for big bad bruce to punch them again dude sucks,negative
im shocked this comment section hasnt been taken over by lobotomy corporation or geometry dash players yet,negative
i meandr light was literally a pedophile and a rapist in current day comics they would have just offed him and called it a day,negative
supes and bats needed a damn reality check,negative
to be fair zatanna wasnt intending nor trying to lobotomize dr light she was trying to remove his memory of assaulting sue and of the secret identities of the other league members that hed acquired while he was on the satellite the muddying of his intellect was an unintentional side effect now when she lets herself get talked into attempting to use magic to help reform some of the villains the the top that was deliberately doing something deeper and more questionable than securing data or not letting a sa perpetrator savor the memory of his crime and this was the start of a slippery slope but she didnt mean to mess up his mind and the justice league didnt decide to lobotomize dr light,negative
batman did nothing wrong,negative
dumbasses went against their sugar daddys morals,negative
he pulls his funding green arrow and aquaman shit i gotta start paying rent,negative
so much righteousness for what jl did to dr light in the comments hope you guys never find out about that guy called the punisher,negative
holier than thou batman who never really helped anyone he literally can save the world with just his money alone,negative
its interesting to see over half the commenters support rapists,negative
identity crisis has some questionable things,negative
its funny how when they do to him what he does to them his faith in them is broke,negative
yeah those contingency plans were necessary,negative
batman and superman arent there for damage control bruce is a trained medic and clark can hear people under ruins no way they would just leave,negative
batman cant stay he has gotham a day without him he is hell super cant stay cause he has to be everywhere flash cant stay cause he basically keeps his city afloat,negative
illuminati shit,negative
zoom in on how bad hawwkman looks in this story,negative
its worth noting clark almost went into a blind rage aswell i believe it was this series when he found out what they did to brce and he gently as he could confronts the league about it and green lantern puts his hand on clarks shoulder to say it was the only way only for clark to grab his hand and break it following up with do not touch me his eyes glowing red it cuts to the rest of the league who rightfully are about to wet themselves at this sight,negative
if you have an insanely powerful and dangerous individual proven to use their immense power to abuse the helpless as a monster what the justice league did was valid mind melting and reshaping dr light into a person who wont abuse and hurt powerless innocents and to be honest batman is straight doo doo in the head the joker should be dead but batman will protect the joker because the writers want the joker as a constant nemesis batman is mentally insane so he creates the no kill rule for himself because he cant control himself and will just go on murder rampages where the crime does not fit the punishment because batman is actually a peanut brain from writersyndrome and yet he forces this on others so from how stupid the writers made batmans ideology and his nokill rule reasoning batman wouldve opposed ending the reign of a superpowered monster who did nasty things to powerless women,negative
most people wouldve killed dr light if he raped their wife or friend this is honestly one of the dumbest plotlines ever and makes batman look like a petulant child,negative
im gonna call bullshit on the writing batman is exactly the guy who would meticulously figure out where every villain should go and how they should contained,negative
give me an explanation guys,negative
zatanna did this to selina too i dont blame bruce for not trusting her,negative
hey fan of your videos but the information in your pinned comment is slightly wrong it was not decided by the ogs of the og justice league as zatanna hawkman green arrow atom nor elongated mam are original memebers of the team,negative
id love to see full comic breakdowns froms you i always leave your shorts wanting more pause,negative
wiping someones memory even for just a moment is proving you dont trust them and would be willing to do it again in the right circumstances and if you cant trust your memories than you cant trust anyone and shouldnt,negative
it was around this time i stopped reading dc comics i havent been back since and from the look of things i made a wise decision,negative
goes to show that batman regulating and observing all the members didnt gonfar enough dewpitr all the protests and how dare yous from the other members,negative
never mess with batman,negative
the gotham robber did piss poor job letting alfred adopt this loser,negative
bruce wayne is trash,negative
gonna nitpick your grammar you dont do a decision you make a decision,negative
more proof that batman is a complete jerk,negative
so batman and superman never participated in how punishment should be dealt to there foes but allowed their companions to make the decision because they trusted them in making the right decision is that what i am supposed to be getting,negative
not a lot of justice in extra judicial punishment,negative
superman wasnt there for the cleanup bs he was there for the cleanup he just wasnt there when these selfappointed judges and executioners went outside the law but this whole storyline was bizarre and meh,negative
the fact that all the moviestv shows dont include this arc but do include all of bats countermeasures entirely miss the point of why its needed,negative
i dont like that ga went along with this it seems out of character,negative
involve batman in the cleanup,negative
imagine getting betrayed by not just your teammates but your own childhood friend,negative
bruce truly did love zatanna but her actions shattered any kind of future between them,negative
why did bruce target clark and wally during the tower of babylon the art suggests he went after those two as well,negative
i find it hard to believe that batman and superman would not stick around to make sure the problems are properly dealt with especially batman,negative
my honest opinion about identity crisis batmans a bit of a hypocrite because dude didnt you have protocols tokilled every single hero of the justice league then let that protocol get in the hands of of one of your most powerful enemies who then use it against the justice league,negative
yeahi dont see the critics coming up with a good solution to deal with villains that doesnt involve killing,negative
i loved this lead up to its was an awesome read,negative
they i would of activated my contingency plans after that,negative
aint no way they mind wiped batman he was right all along,negative

was it really just this that he had said done that people are freaking out about honestly i thought he had had wild sex parties p diddy style or had exhibited really immoral antisocial behavior such as showing public sympathy for trump and elon or something just as bad as this would have been d come on people you have far worse things going on in your society that you should concentrate on being outraged about besides he probably just didnt have time to think before he quickly had to come up with something to ask about which he imagined would be funny and his humor is apparently quite childish and seems to be that butt weewee and momdad without clothes on jokes are the funniest and yes a little awkwardly said by a grown man and we can easily agree here that he definitely does not have any professional stand up comedy hidden inside him but it wasnt the end of the world either at most a little embarrassing for himself afterwards,negative

i really am scared by the indecisiveness of the people all the people in comment section are targeting him because of what he said in it but actually no one cares about actual horrors it was just escalated by media for a fact we cannot set a boundary in comedy because boundary will differ by perspectives if what he said has really offended you than you should just not watch it just going with the flow is really wrong and unexpected from people if anyone differs lets debate,negative
everthing has its own limit one should not cross the line and i think he did that,negative

shes disgusting in every aspect,negative
wait hold on is she not wearing a top under her suit,negative

wow shes vile,negative
she signed it dont get what the fuss is about,negative
shes no athlete,negative
it wont be long and that kid will see rapinoe for what she is a narcissistic fool who offers nothing,negative
i dont get it she signed the ball and gave it back to him whats the problem,negative
we can see seconds and every people are angry against rapinoe i dont got the truth but i would like to see before and after what happen and not too close because maybe people were talking to her in the same time seconds think about it,negative
probably a mercy autograph anyway,negative
simple to see shes clearly a racist,negative
bro at the back flabbergasted as to why he would ask for her autograph,negative

that ball worth nothing lol why that boy even bother throw its in the bin,negative
typical,negative
kid deserved better hope he wasnt too bothered by it,negative
seconds to give the kid a smile or a slight nod would have made his day that a sports star gave him acknowledgement instead made it seem like an inconvenience and that she is to big to be spoken to by the lower life forms i have met quite a few celebrities many football players soccer in my home town when we was in the premier league after watching a game i would wait out the stadium for a chance of an autograph some would sign some would not but most would alway acknowledge fans you did get the occasional player who never appreciated fans but most were so nice and down to earth players like gary oneal linvoy primus and richard hugues impractical were always wonderful to fans and any pompey fan will always sing their praise as they always made seconds for fans i remember gary oneil was in a rush one day and he apologised and said couldnt sign any autographs today and i said ok mate you played well today and think its because i was a teenager at the time he felt he had to sign he just turned round and said alright mate give me your program quickly signed it and gave me a smile and a nod even if he didnt sign it just to be acknowledged was something i told my dad and brothers about all night the signature was secondary because he spoke to me personally it was a really happy memory,negative
shes very arrogant she will be replaced by the men she wants to playin her leagues,negative
she completely defines the c word,negative
thats why she missed that penalty kick,negative

horrible person,negative
the man in the background is watching that the boy asked for whose autograph,negative
self destruction at its finest,negative
that autograph depreciates in value every day,negative
quite a few jealous people commenting here love it the more you hate the more i hope to see rapinoe get more of the spotlight you rock rapinoe,negative
what the issue,negative
she should learn something from messi and learn how to be humble and appreciate your fans,negative
is she not wearing a bra is that kid looking at her breasts maybe she is embarassed i know i would be in that outfit,negative
is she not wearing what i think shes not wearing,negative
instead of playing football why dont you cover the top a bit,negative
as a soccer fan i can just say i hate her and i love the uswnt and my teacher hates megan raponie even though she loves the uswnt even my friend who is a democrat hates her so much i would prefer to watch mens soccer i prefer to watch players like cristiano ronaldo and erling haaland shes the reason why womens soccer is so hated even though i love to watch womens players especially manchester city,negative
you mean the controversy was her not looking at the child and not the fact she is extremely inappropriately dressed in front of children she is interacting with the kid was probably trying to look away as soon as he could because of it,negative
wouldnt suppose she was embarrassed by the way she was dressed when a boy comes over for an autograph dark,negative
racist,negative
megan rapinoe couldnt score on j howard marshall,negative
probably the hottest woman on earth,negative

two of them gonna be island boy today,negative
its just survivor but with children i couldnt agree more,negative
it had to be done science must advance no sacrifice is to large for the greater good lol,negative
fact that this was not a bad idea it was just executed poorly,negative
me thinking oh is not like the lord of the flies at least they are not brutally killing animalsoh never mind,negative
nike pays for abortions i cant stand child killers and those that support it,negative
kid nation is not only a horrible and even inhumane idea for a reality show but also a horrible idea for a country in general who thought of this should we arrested,negative
these are all child actors being kids,negative
i dont know im now and im pretty sure my year old self would love to join kid nation is definitely too young though,negative
would have been better if it were teenagers,negative
yes lord of the flies english class yall,negative
babes no way,negative
show seems pretty cool to me wish they did more seasons,negative
video starts a,negative
something of the likes of vaulttec evil corporation level idea,negative
total drama island irl with kids mixed with survivor,negative
the same people furious about a show teaching kids some real time lessons while allowing them to have some fun are the same ones who wouldnt of thought twice about sending their kids to nickelodeons dan schneider in the s if he offered them a job nothing wrong with this show i didnt watch it but see it as being a good learning experience and far safer than a kid in hollywood with an acting career surrounded by trusting adults,negative
looks just like my childhood,negative
i became at writing a comment,negative
maybe this show unintentionally proved gws point about the soft bigotry of low expectations for thousands of years kids contributed to their families survivalworking helping learning real skills today too many grow softphysically and mentallybecause theyre expected to do nothing but chase their whims no ones saying we should send kids back to the coal mines but maybe schools should be more than a place to sit at a desk all day and be lectured about how evil capitalism is,negative
someone william golding its only more syllables,negative
didnt jontron cover this like years ago,negative
this is child abuse,negative
omg untrained kids killing and eating chickens just wow,negative
im guessing all of the kids who were already bullies or were high in self confidence would say it was a good learning experience while all of the shy introverted or emotional kids would say it was a horrible experience that they were scarred by,negative
years later former contestants began to speak out to capitalize on the situation edit fixed it for ya,negative
theres a reason adults are required to ask for another adults consent when a child is involved instead of the childs consent and theres a reason an adult can force a child to do something they dont want to do children dont know whats best for them they dont have the life experience to take care of themselves its up to the adults to be responsible for their care and wellbeing and these parents prioritizing money over their own children should be evaluated holy cow theyre human lives not travel employees,negative
i dont see the issue with giving kids chores allowing them to cook for themselves or god forbid killing a chicken that is what our grandparents did growing up on a farm kids these days grow up with zero responsibility or understanding of where food comes from most of these kids look happy and excited to be here its hardly lord of the flies great book and movie btw,negative
wait didnt jontron do a video on this,negative
i think it was great they learned so much about real life in this world eating beans and rice was my favorite reality to american spoiled brats lol,negative
of course they sent the kids to nm,negative
im as far in as talking about the teams day and all i can think is this is psychological warfare on children,negative
ahhhhh the show wasnt that bad give me a break i wouldve loved to have gone on that show when i was that age of course my friends and i were going camping and having adventures in the woods when we were kids folks nowadays believe kids are delicate flowers that need constant supervision no wonder they are growing up soft as babyshit,negative
am i the only person on this planet that thinks this show was a good idea kids should be given more freedom i still look back on my childhood wishing i was able to be more free have rights and experiment with life this gave kids a once in a lifetime chance to be free from the chains of parents and adults i wish i had that opportunity when i was young i always felt oppressed and sometimes feared adults including my parents,negative
why the bible,negative
ship my kid off for five grand why not what the hell is wrong with people,negative
jimmy is smart be like jimmy,negative
look at the producers nose everey single time,negative
it wasnt that bad thats the reality of so many children in africa,negative
so were the kids upset or the parents of the kids upset or just viewers and people watching the show with their opinions not knowing what the set was like with that many people on any tv production there has to be fire and medical staff available as well at all times this is very onesided video i am not a fan of your channel,negative
how many crew members are on the camera and production crew on that set where were those people sleeping what were they eating your video is like half the information why the kids all have different clothing to wear and their hair is done im not understanding the disparity here if there are literally or adults that have to be there with producers and cameraman and microphone and youre gonna tell me they couldnt leave kids never looked in the camera once somehow all of them know how to not look into the camera while drama is happening no one looks into the camera once thats impossible and theyre not all child actors theyre two sides new mexico deals with a lot of child abuse and neglect and labor law issues there is no way some show is just gonna shoot them away and convince them as you say that easily,negative
taylor became a member of the hoa,negative
ive heard of lord of the flies but jesus,negative
i was a cub scout at the time and i loved kid nation wanted to be on the show but it slowly devolved into something akin to lord of the flies,negative
your perspective added absolutely nothing to the already existing content on this subject it feels like a waste of minutes after watching it,negative
children exploited by greedy adults again,negative
those kind of contracts are not enforceable still i suspect the biggest secret was that the whole thing was scripted the kids actually slept in relatively good accommodations with enough bathrooms and showers and had nutritious though maybe not tasty food the chickens thing was also scripted imho otherwise the inspectors would not have just left the producers turned them away yeah right inspectors are gods we forget there were guys there with cameras,negative
children of the corn,negative
i remember watching this show when i was younger at the time i thought it was really cool but i was also a kid and didnt realize how dangerous that actually is,negative
there is a couple of other shows that experiment with leaving young children alone one is called boys and girls alone and the other is called boys alone and another separate one called girls alone both made in britain in the s all pretty interesting especially the contrast in which the boys behaved alone vs the girls,negative
as a kid i would love to go as a parent i would never let my kid go but hey it didnt look that harsh have you ever been to summer camp i mean the real one not the hotel in a forest,negative
i think its a great idea could use some guidelines but kids are too sheltered from what really hard work is and the pride it brings to them,negative
not controversial enough,negative
they didnt even give the kids a fair chance it would have gone better if the producers just didnt mess with them,negative
thanks for digging this out of my memories i wanted to be on this show so badly lmao,negative
lord of the flies,negative
what a shit show they didnt leave these kids alone to figure it out for themselves and see how it went they did exactly what the government does to us they lead them into the situations they wanted those kids in dividing them and then ranking them by rich to poor was bullshit nothing like leaving them alone to see what happens when they were being programmed eeshhhhh what bs,negative
no running water for kids is just criminal many adults can barely maintain their hygiene with all amenitys,negative
viva revolution is crazy,negative
you have so great content please keep the good work i subscribed to you,negative
wild,negative
easy to get demonetized for talking about what happens when year olds are left alone but that is something that has come up in the amas i feel reality tv needs shows like this once in a while to keep us from slowly slipping down the slope towards the long walk becoming real so over the top insane it makes even the dumbest of us take a look at what weve become,negative
if lord of the flies is the most disturbing book you ever read you either dont read a lot or you are soft but kid nation could have been a hit if it wasnt a survival show it could have been a loose survival show but it isnt far off from where my parents sent me during summer for camp and how were were boy scouts disney did it a few times and now one batted an eye,negative
this show was so good didnt watch the video just wanted to say how funny the show was,negative
that dan schneider is concerned about kids is ironic,negative
im only half way through the video but omg surviving on rice and beans alone at an age where they should be eating a variety of nutritional food dont their parents and the staff care,negative
i do like the idea of this show but it could have been done so much better this was so poorly made,negative
i can remember watching this with my mom every episode we would think there is no way my son would survive nor would we want him to go it,negative
im an adult and i cant even do half of this killing a live chicken even though i eat them is already too much freezing water and doing laundry for three people is already challenging enough how much more for people and with everything else on top of that,negative
is there a where are they now,negative
literally holes,negative
ngl you look like decoy voice,negative
anyone can deal w it idc what yall say they signed up for it they need a kids signature aswell for it so they willingly did it imo,negative
they should bring it back learn some real world lessons and skills and stop being a bunch of pussies,negative
this would had been a great show in ancient rome,negative
lmao that was actually pretty mild nowhere near the most controversial reality show of all time,negative
i saw some documentary as a kid about a group of british kids living together in a house with no parents sort of big brother kids edition i dont remember what it was called but i thought this might be about that,negative
great ending amazing video,negative
producers,negative
i watched the show when it was on i think people make too much of the chicken stuff young people are taught to kill for food all over the world since the beginning of time its only within this small chunk of time in a small amount of land that the concept is so foreign,negative
why would i spend time with people i dont know if i could like choose people then it would lowkey it would be fun,negative
i dunno who thought watching kids be kids is entertaining this was boring we already read lord of the flies meh,negative
i kind of wanted to watch this but i couldnt find when and where it was playing,negative
this show was dope and the kids did an amazing job still think about it til this day tbh i feel like ppl think its fun to hate on stuff as a bandwagon like we geddit jontron covered this literal years ago the show is actually decent,negative
thousand dollars is nothing considering what theyre being expected to do,negative
those poor kids that had to watch the chicken die,negative
even the rarest kind of all missing,negative
lord of the flies was fun but it was a movie,negative
thats literally lord of the flies,negative
i watched this weekly wild times,negative
could you please pack more ads in your videos a few more ads and you could break the threshold of ads to content,negative
so no one read lord of the flies just meokaaaayyy,negative
what could possibly go wrong,negative
never give someone who cant interpret a book a camera and too much money,negative
you make great videos great personality it is easy to get distracted but if you keep your focus on good stories stick to the important details and continue focusing on your storytelling it is tempting to make click bait type thumbnails and titles to temporarily gain more views but seems this is short lived and several channels that turned to this i found myself watching them less and less long term your stragety might grow the channel slower but this growth is genuine and will build an audience that will stay with you long term and truly care about you and what you do best of luck man,negative
having the parents sign a release doesnt remove liability lawsuits can still be filed and persued on behalf of the children you cant sign away somebody elses rights,negative
no sir whos your daddy was way more controversial got pulled after the first episode,negative
im really confused i get told constantly about how kids are little people with agency yet yet these same people dont want kids to actually have any agency,negative
im proud that the american public basically didnt like it,negative
did you read the end of lord of the flies,negative
do you all think there were no adults off scene,negative
so a show that is about an experiment how kids act when they are left alone has added elements like a studioselected council and a enforced class system we know what will happen if kids are in a lord of the fly situation because the premise of lord of the flies is based on a real event and the real event was that the kids cooperated and build a working society cared for each other and survived for years until they were rescued,negative
omg the class system was so terrible that wrecks everything it would have been interesting if the kids had been left to decide who to distribute labour on their own maybe make challenges for one group to skip labour any labour for a time and thats it,negative
this gives lord of the flies energy,negative
nah yall too soft this taught the kids lots of things and made them stronger,negative
ship my kid for grand why not a begger,negative
i begged my parents to sign me up for the season that never came when i was like i think i was lol,negative
i enjoyed that show,negative
it feels kinda dumb that people were getting upset at kids having to do some hard work when there were so many other fucked up things going on,negative
pawning your kids for basically,negative
there are literally camermen,negative
when you think that reality shows can not become more ridiculous,negative
nothing insane or controversial here its reality tv its fake and scripted,negative
these fetuses are surviving better than adults,negative
and of course we as a society who rap our kids in cotton wool this hard work for kids is going to be really bad dad for them this is just get people to watch your channel so you can make it so bad that no one is watching them um they had child psychologist on the set the kids still saw adults all day because the adults run the whole show it taught kids to work things things out together without the help of adults thats a real bad thing to do teach kids to be good adults and oh no just think kids had to learn where meat came from like our jobs as parents are not to teach our children to be good people no our jobs are to make sure there stay safe and inside on devices and never give them any hard challenges,negative
and the show host who comes in is a kids too,negative
of course its kids out in the desert with no adults im mean kids are running the tv cameras and the production is run by kids really,negative
the idea of privileges is dumb you just need to rotate the groups through each set of chores,negative
ill ship my child off for grand girl what,negative
i remember watching this show i thought what a bizarre concept,negative
i remember this i wanted to go so badly lmao,negative
huh is this the turning point when peoples begins to turn woke over protect them they will traumatize and get mental illness,negative
duuuuh adults are stupid this is nature in action,negative
this show would be great and legal in mexico,negative
oh boy lets clip other youtubers who watched the show years later into the vid thats interesting,negative
very few kids of color this is not a melanin thing,negative
is it bad that i would actually want to be apart if something like this but not that part where the fed lies to the kids because i was literally just talking about this with my family saying how i think i would do good on the show or something like this show because if it wasnt for entertainment purposes i feel like me and the other kids grow a lot from this and learn a lot of skills also i wouldnt want to do the like weekly challenges i feel like they should just rotate every week which group does what chore so its a fair system,negative
lets make a show where we guarantee kids are miserable,negative
looks entertaining to me,negative
i loved this show some of the kids were too young but i would have wanted to do it as a kid too,negative
not sure why its very controversial but its lowkey fun to participate in the show as kid myself,negative
i think the show is fine because they can leave at whatever time they want its absolutely fine like i guess they should have classes but they earned it and they can leave whenever they want so,negative
why do i hearspectacular music,negative
ironically the kids werent the problem it was the adults that messed things up with the challenges and forced status structure,negative
theo made the systemy for the kids bcs with no system the kids would have a comunist life in this place,negative
so battle royale but without weapons,negative
pov chris mclean,negative
you forgot to mention some other controversial parts like when the older boys were vandelizng some of the towns buildings when the kids punished taylor for not helping with her chores etc,negative
if they were a few years older theyd be doing drugs and having rampant unprotected sex out there,negative
doesnt seem like it was that bad to me,negative
oh my god i watched till this point but if they dont cook it just a tiny bit good they would either get salmonella or burnt food,negative
players minecraft civilization in real life,negative
well thats just how some poor kids live,negative
damnhaving a network make millions of your kids for a k cheque is wild,negative
out of left that tells me alot about what the kids experienced during the show,negative
kids should never be left unsupervised however the chicken thing my sons had killed a lot more than chickens by years old and cleaned them so i dont see the big deal in a year old with experience preparing a chicken,negative
someone wrote a book,negative
skip the yap,negative
bro people just to sensitive their being monitored an can leave at any time an besides all that f them kids,negative
something is missing guyzz,negative
tendulkar was cleaning a ball stupid,negative
australia sand paper,negative
sand paper,negative
love not seeing the cape town incident on the list,negative
no more australians fuking video,negative
the intro is somethin else lol,negative
why stop the video,negative
swiss cheese lined up instructor pilot pinc someone should have been spotting without nvgs when was the last altimeter correction when was the asos updated why dont those helos have tcas yes i know they are military why havent we bought a tcas and provided it to them,negative
for those wondering if feet moe is acceptable for an altimeter readingits not not by icao standard nor faa standard and there shouldnt be a separation thats less than feet anyway,negative
didnt the same thing happen like months ago,negative
theres been an unusual amount of midair plane crashes lately how could the helicopter pilots not see a large american airlines plane they flew right into it,negative
a woman was flying the helicopter end of investigation,negative
it was avoidable the helicopter crew should have been more alert the jet crew is concentrating on final approach and landing they cannot take evasive action easily the helicopter approaches from the blind side on the right the jets landing lights are on the helicopter crew could not have missed it no evasive action by the helicopter crew to go above or swing left at the last few minutes ploughing straight through,negative
old military aircraft equipment pilots shouldnt have been wearing night vision goggles in this area so many questions,negative
its one of the most frustrating accidents ever and they still have near misses on that exact same route,negative
fake news,negative
oh so they are saying blackhawk should of flown across the flight path of a incoming aircraft with a margin of error wow what a bs cover story,negative
why have a helicopter near the runway at all im no genius but that makes no sense humans i tell ya we aint smart,negative
the helicopter should have never been flying in a landing path anyway,negative
the mandate to have women in military roles at all costs did this the equipment was not off by feet,negative
investigation theres no need for that all it was was miscalculation by the driver of the helicopter,negative
the real questions should be why are those who left the flight paths in place not being charged with negligent homicide why are the military leaders who believed this was an appropriate location for night vision not being charged with negligent homicide,negative
the plane should have movedthey saw the helicopter,negative
my league of legends teammates when they die to a gank with wards in the river,negative
,negative
barometric altimeters are inherently inaccurate to an extent they need to be set to a known reference they shouldnt be far off in a flight of this duration unless a big weather front is passing that said military versions are certainly more accurate than i would know about no excuses in such a high traffic corridor to not know exactly where you are,negative
could it be that the helicopter had the wrong altimeter setting an altimeter is subject to atmospheric settings above feet the standard setting is under that it changes depending on atmospheric pressure,negative
please dont blame the damn helicopter incompetence flying the helicopter was the cause of the crash,negative
i feel like china is somehow involved in all these plane crashes some type of interference,negative
red dress,negative
bs army is covering this up dei pilot is to blame,negative
trumps military elons cuts to faa,negative
its tragic avoidable and when youre operating on outdated equipment things happen,negative
collisions like this always happen because of multiple failures at once and this time proved no difference the black hawk was flying at feet which is above the foot limit for helicopters its altimeter was broken and showing to feet lower than it actually was plus the tcas traffic collision avoidance system was turned off and to make things worse only one atc staff was handling both the helicopter and plane the another personnel had already left condolences for the victims,negative
but i dont get you seeing the video other airplanes that are miles away coming in the land too and this blackhawk is flying in an area where they shouldnt have been flying in the first place and it aint the first time theres been almost a midair collision they have a report of it these people have should have never lost their lives even the people in the helicopter i feel sorry theyre service men and women and the people on that airplane should have messed never lost their lives why in the hill is there a helicopter flying in a flight path for landing airplanes to a major airport its like having a civilian airplane if they wouldve flown in that it would have been oh youre gonna lose your license they should make it even military aircraft should not be allowed to fly in a commerchant airliners area not near an airport unless its for an emergency these people shouldnt never lost their lives and at the first time theres almost been a midair collision they should have not been flying in that area that helicopter i feel sorry for everybody involved their families and you could tell that guys son was a pilot he said he tried flying that plane all the way down its tragic this s should never happen,negative
it wasnt an accident,negative
theyre just talking in circles military messed up period,negative
considering that at altitude minimum vertical separation is feet even feet margin is insignificant if you have feet to spare closer to airports at low altitudes you should have horizontal separation the helicopter path and the path of the aircraft were too close to each other,negative
controller should never have allowed that helicopter to enter the airspace knowing a jet was inbound feet is not enough of a safety margin unbelievable,negative
so terrible only hope this will bring changes that will save future lives,negative
the dei female pilot is responsible,negative
this accident still upsets and disturbs me to my core to this day this should never have happened beyond tragic,negative
an accident waiting to happen helicopter routes should not be anywhere near dca airport that includes from the white house and the pentagon,negative
god rest their souls its horribly upsetting,negative
helicopters fault no common sense,negative
thats physics all they need to do is go back to pre patterns and allow choppers to overfly land and stay away from approach departure paths easy fix but decision adverse faa wont do it of choppers in dc are usg anyway they will never shoot one down so concede the reality that passenger safety is paramount plus up atc and require all location technology to be used but nah thats impossible yah,negative
female pilot,negative
years ago today general motors was still massproducing the first generation chevelle thats what im celebrating,negative
given the pilot of the chopper was a biden lgbt ideologue i wouldnt be the least bit surprised if she intentionally caused the crash,negative
further an example of why trump does not represent all americans,negative
im sorry but near all disasters require a series of things to happen else theyd not be exceptional disasters i think the big question is how is considered adequate clearance forget the altimeter thats the tiniest movement of the yoke at the wrong moment its like or mph in your car speed the smallest move of your foot or the incline of the road and you break past that limit this helo route should not have been available while and aircraft was on approach and yes that would likely mean having to hop across in between approaches a little like crossing a road,negative
we all know whats going on here stop beating around the bush and making exuses for poor piloting on the helicopter,negative
did that news reporter just ask what have we learnt is he from england or something,negative
the army is percent responsible for this the officers who sent that chopper out there on that route the crew for not having someone not wearing nvgs and scanning note nvgs seriously restrict your visual perception and one crew member shouldnt have been wearing them to scan for things like this seems to me the army is trying to blame equipment when theyre at fault for the negligent homicide of passengers,negative
i dont think i saw a new video nor any new evidence in this clip im not saying daily passenger life is any less but in a time of war do we want these machines instruments to be off like that,negative
statement here s ft of operating space just isnt enough and with teh modules misreading up to as much as ft feet clearence isnt enough due to wild winds at time s unannounced how about a no fly zone durring incoming traffic ever thought of that but moreso was the firring of millions of air traffic controllers direct impli cations as soon as he took office he passed a bunch of executive orders and air traffic control was one of them cut,negative
usa military rules allowing the helicopter that close got them killed its crazy how military can practice in civilian airspace but we cant use theirs or we get shot down,negative
that was a suicide bomber by us military or that was a remote control helicopter and they killed them on purpose theres no way u dont hear them or see them while ur flying in a literal arrival zone,negative
it was hard to watch the video where helicopter crashed into this plane seems both helicopter pilots were wearing a night vision googles with a narrow view of their surroundings had one of the pilots not wearing one may have seen that passenger planes bright navi lights in time to change in an different direction to avoid a collision bottom line that military helicopter shouldnt be near that airport anyway unless its their approach to land tragedy all around,negative
why are you ntsb faa allowing aircraft with pilots wearing night vision goggles to mess around on the final approach for commercial aircraft its sheer lunacy im sure the passengers would not have consented to the added high risk of death if given the choice,negative
see and avoid of this crash was because pat said in sight and they were wrong no pilot flies into something he sees planes wires mountains why did pat call visual twice why seeing the rj zero times start your investigation there the other of the problem is routes atc altimeter errors ad nauseum,negative
the amount of vectors that had to align for both of these to collide thats absolutely incredible,negative
planning of trainingchecking routes through high density traffic areas is to blame there are countless moas and certainly less dense traffic areas off in the other direction from where the check flight originated the only thing i know for certain is that nobody responsible for planning the route will face any action nor even be asked to explain their thinking this tragedy is fully owned by those who remain alive and who remain with their rank it was simply a matter of when not if,negative
atc shares a good portion of responsibility in this atc should have been requesting pat to decrease altitude long ahead of this crash those who have seen the radar screen data could tell you that pat was too high very distinctively with the scope display data do you have aircraft in sight means nothing at this airport at night there were too many other airliners stacked in line to land it looked like a funeral procession in midair,negative
the holes in the swiss cheese lined up,negative
and the government will find some way to blame the airline for the crash,negative
possibility that the copter pilot was committing suicide,negative
what about the air traffic controller that watched two radar blips converge knowing they were with a few hundred feet in altitude with possible instrument errors,negative
with all the money spent on the military you think they could fix the altimeter,negative
it was reported earlier that the instructor pilot told the female pilot to turn and go behind the plane and that she didnt alter course dei causes people to die in life or death situations competence is more important than inclusivity those people were sacrificed on the altar of dei,negative
close to a trillion in military budget yet the choppers dont work properly,negative
the girl flying the helicopter is way too high that looks hundreds of feet too high she was supposed to be below ft not at or above dei appointment,negative
blackhawk helicopter is military copter doesnt have radar or warning system,negative
the helo was not navigating safely they reported seeing the aa aircraft they had not altimeters are to be set prior to take off the militarys margins and lowtrained inexperienced pilots and there not being a look out not in nightvision goggles doomed everyone,negative
us military its no excuse that a trained pilot didnt see a commercial plane in plain sight arent you trained to see potential threats rip to the families,negative
wow i thought the copter had turned and then ran into the plane this looks like the copter flew straight into the plane makes it look like a sinister tragedy,negative
the helicopter pilot had visibility of the plane through the windows of the helicopter whether atc warned the helicopter or not the blackhawk helicopter pilot should have been able to see a plane directly in front of him as he flew into the side of it,negative
ntsb has no jurisdiction over military aircraft a dog pony show a deliberate act a helicopter pilot uses visual ques for keeping altitude below feet,negative
a deliberate act by the h pilot,negative
america is becoming an unsafe place to fly in,negative
hearing that father talk about his son the copilot breaks my heart i pray that god would graciously give peace to those who are still mourning because of this tragedy,negative
i read somewhere that the female pilot of the copter had not completed the required number of hours of flight training for becoming a pilot of a copter i also read somewhere that she resented taking orders from a male is any of this true correct me if its not,negative
regardless of inconsistencies in the altimeter the helicopter pilots were told by atc to hold and fly behind the airliner they did not do that because they didnt see them more needs to be done to avoid this kind of tragedy from ever happening again like maybe rerouting altogether helicopter traffic away from airplanes landing if possible,negative
im a private pilot never commercial never helicopter aircraft anyone with a brain can see that having active flight routes within feet of approaching airliners is a bad idea it needs to be fixed and the politics needs to stay out of it for the good if everyone the fact this wasnt addressed until a midair collision took place is very sad and awful,negative
it looked like it was a deliberate act to me how could she be that incompetent,negative
i thought trump had already figured out it was dei and he is a stable genius,negative
cbs sucks,negative
dca is my home airport and this has bothered me since the night it happened it is so heartbreaking for the families,negative
so the army with the decades long concurrence of the faa willingly allows a squadron of helicopters with known altimeter errors of up to to operate under the precision approach path indicator glideslope for runway at dca unfucking believable,negative
so the helicopter pilot absolutely knew there are crossing traffic patterns where was their situational awareness simply looking left where traffic would normally be originating from would have prevented this also the faa should never allow this kind of traffic pattern where aircraft intersect within a couple hundred vertical feet,negative
who else was clueless about the november crash i had no idea people died in a plane crash in new york city only two months after,negative
this was one of the most avoidable aviation accidents ever,negative
this helicopter corridor needs to be sealed for good and anywhere else they have this dumb an idea i dont care how convenient it is for the military either move the airport go around or you can only go through when atc confirms no incoming or outgoing traffic,negative
there should be nothing in the way of that plane within ft unless its another lane making a parallel landing on parallel runway nothing even ft let alone ft is way too small a margin of error by magnitudes,negative
stop mansplaining the female helicopter dei pilot aint listening to no man i do what i want,negative
my condolences to all who perished in this disaster that unfortunately should never have happened yet despite all the investigations nothing has ever been released to my knowledge of where the barometric settings were on the altimeters on the black hawk fly navy,negative
funny stuff in this broadcast the black news commentator an employee of cbs questions the accuracy of the altimeter cbs questioning accuracy wow talk about hypocritical commentary what a loser,negative
so after six months the ntsb still has pretty much zero idea what happened hmmm weird absolutely tells me the pilot was at fault she wasnt properly trained didnt listen to commands and ended all of those lives keep in mind they scrubbed her facebook as soon as this happened that woman had no business flying in one of the busiest air corridors in the country,negative
these guys are arguing about an altitude gauge as if that was the big issue here those aircraft shouldve been separated by a lot more than a few feet,negative
joe bidens dei hires,negative
positive control air space should not have procedures that do not have instrument error or pilot deviation built in the only thing positive about this route procedure is that a mid air would happen sooner or later years of system error repots were ignored,negative
ugh this is hard to listen to so tragic for all those victims and their families,negative
i think there are somethings happened the humen dont understand yet but some people did,negative
no other place in the world has active flight routes crossing active approaches within a foot window that is the issue here they need to remove all routes that cross any approach inside the tca with less than foot seperation dont blame the altimeter blame the allowable traffic pattern,negative
after blaming the dead pilot now start blaming the altitude meter,negative
pilots listen to airport weather before takeoff and landing such as wind speed and direction including barometric pressure that is used to set the altimeter on landing pilots use precision approach path indicator papi a system of lights on the side of an airport runway threshold that provides visual descent guidance information during final approach the issue was with the helicopter and not properly setting the altimeter before takeoff a foot variance is not possible on an aircraft flying at feet with a properly set altimeter imagine if the helicopter was flying an indicated feet the actual altitude would be about feet well outside safe flying conditions things like that are not taken lightly especially by the military the helicopter pilot became lazy and did not verify their altimeter was set correctly,negative
so they havent learned anything in six months zero accountability,negative
they are still dead,negative
i wonder if the widow of the philippine police colonel who was killed in this crash have been notified of this hearing,negative
its hard to imagine how two professional pilots about to cross the final approach of an international airport dont look for landing traffic even if u have been cleared common sense is to look just like you make sure the final approach is clear when you are given clearance for takeoff and you are about to taxi on to the active runway so sad,negative
so did i miss the memo army allow blind people to fly helicopter now,negative
remember the uss fitzgerald captain on the bridge,negative
in this case vertical separation is not relevant planes should never fly over an operational helicopter horizontal separation was the problem here,negative
what a utterly ridiculous scenario to occur in the first place have army stopped using flight paths as a training ground yet,negative
altimeter pfff more like dei,negative
not even surprised with how much they tried to shove dei down our throats they rather cover for their dei policies than admit the truth to the hundreds of victims families,negative
the black hawk helicopter should not have been flying in this airspace many near collisions have happened at this airport with helicopters ignoring the problem allowed this horrible accident to happen my heart goes out to the families,negative
no accident but intentional,negative
the helicopter should not have even been there in the first place,negative
the helicopter was at fault regardless of faulty gauges the pilot was not a blind person if the fact they were wearing night vision head gear was a factor that contributed to the crash why would they be allowed to wear them i see nothing but deflecting the blame to someone else the plane was doing what it was supposed to be doing why was the chopper doing anything in that restricted area thats the issue that needs to be solved and answered doesnt anyone use common sense when investigating to make sure it never happens again and put blame on the person who failed to use any common sense,negative
i heard the hc pilots both had elmo tattoos you know what that means,negative
sounds like a bunch more guberment lies and cover up to me,negative
the altimeter works fine and they are just trying to get out of saying it was a persons fault,negative
dei is a joke in yo town,negative
since november isnt it september,negative
i was getting kinda used to being someone you loved that hit me,negative
total bullcrap there was no glitch the recordings proved it the mainstream media still shilling for the lies false narratives of democrats,negative
altimeter error thats total bs theyre trying to obfuscate their liability away to mechanical error even with this assumed altimeter error atc allowed these aircraft to get far closer than regulations permit an airliner should never be allowed to get that close to any other plane or structure handing separation duties to the blackhawk is telling the fox to guard your chickens its absolutely shameful and they think were stupid enough to buy it,negative
indeed there were equipment issues that even a technology fix would not do a good enough job to provide a safe operating margin for this airport at the root of it is that any air traffic along or over the potomac in the vicinity of this airport needs to be curtailed,negative
this talk about testing altimiters on other birds is a complete red herring first place they are not the incident bid more importantly if you get into any bird and test the altimeter it will be off thats becase they depend upon the barometeric pressure at that time all aircraft checklists will direct the pilot to check the altimeter before flight the pilot will then adjust the altimeter for the barometric pressure which atc provides or is on atis no pilot with any sense will omit this step but when the pilot returns to the field he leaves the altimiter where he set it of course as the barometric pressure changes the altimeter will vary from correct but thats no problem becasuse the next pilot before he flies will correct the setting in accordance with the checklist and atc or atis info sooo if there were a problem with the blackhawk altimiter the crew should have caught it during preflight checklist checks particulary one like this with an evalutor on board which should make the pilot very careful about crossing is and dotting ts,negative
the more important question is why are we not requiring the military to have tcas on all of their aircraft,negative
bullsht i dont trust what ntsb says i trust what my eyes tell me that the blackhawk flew into the jet dont be fooled by their smoke and mirror games tragedy for these families is not the word,negative
the word you wanted was deviations,negative
thats happen because trumphate brown and block peoplelove and people even if people its fliyein in the ron place god help everybody to stay safe but in this case innocent people pay four oll the hate tankiu,negative
since november of did i miss something,negative
the problem was the female dei pilot who was clearly not qualified due to her inability to even take an order biden should testify as to why he allowed her to be in such a position let us not forget the time given to her people to scrub before her name came out,negative
what do you mean humans couldnt build that thats not that hard it would take a while to do yes but it can be done come on man,negative
so the pilot ignored the atc instructions and the orders from the instructor either incompetent or on purpose,negative
i just cant believe or trust anything coming from any of these alphabet networks if all they did for yrs is cover for biden lie to us about his capacity and never could put forward a different or centrist perspective then you have to prove to me more than ufos,negative
they took her social media accounts down for a reason,negative
i thought when this happened the blakhawk was told to turn left and that they had time to correct their path but the pilot didnt listen and now its a faulty altitude component problemjust say the truth as the families need closure for the loss of their loved onesa major lawsuit will reveal the truth as it is obvious and has to do with flight experience and qualifications of the operator of the blackhawk,negative
way too much bright lighting around the area,negative
ive heard that ground control was in contact with the,negative
typical millennial male or female doesnt matter distracted and working within confines within an impossible grace of trust well train within yards of oncoming air traffic their logic baffles the mind,negative
trump did it,negative
dei pilot in the blackhawk that killed,negative
here in newport beach the government helicopters routinely fly ft agl it causes huge noise pollution its incredibly unsafe somebody snapped a few years ago and shot one down the guy drowned in west palm beach they routinely fly ft agl slightly better but they should fly even higher,negative
ok gauges and instruments are one thing but they had an alarm and never took it seriously maybe i should say the pilot that was flying that bird did not listen to the alarm as well as her instructor probably because she thought he was mansplaining,negative
feet for clearance my yard is ft wide what joke,negative
she was a dei people need to be hired based on merit qualifications nothing else,negative
the woman flying the helicopter was wrong very sloppy did she even have the hours and experience,negative
stupid question to begin with the glide slope to the runway intersects the actual flight path of helicopter lanes the two flight paths were allowed and even marked on the charts the issue is not the blackhawk it is the actual lanes intersecting the margin of error being feet is not acceptable the actual cause was the atc who rerouted unnecessary from and ils glide path to a vfr approach runway for a heavy aircraft instead of attempting to blame anyone on either flight look at the intersecting allowable paths including errorlook at the fact that air traffic control was more worried about an extra take off than about safety pilot error yes the pilot error was the airplanes pilots for not telling the tower f o i am on final i am not changing runways the faa controllers always act as if they are the one who makes the decisions and makes the orders in fact the pic is the captain and can and should tell atc go to hell i was once routed to feet for minutes by atc without oxygen they were informed of contain and still ordered me to do so i will not explain what happens to pilots with oxygen starved brains suffice to say that after that incident i knew never to take an unlawful order or any order that seemed made of convenience i could have been killed and certainly i could have had my license revoked for obeying even though twice i gave a no oxygen on board response and was still ordered to an illegal flight level,negative
politicians wanting to be important riding in these military helicopters as if in a movie caused what occurred stop treating politicians as if in a spy novel,negative
intentional,negative
theyre obviously covering for the military accurate this is all bs,negative
go to to access local perspectives to better understand world politics and current events with ground news save on the ground news unlimited access vantage plan with my link this video was created by a small team in a short amount of time if youd like to support our work feel free to visit,negative
this kid does the best aviation videos,negative
i dont get what is the importance of that training mission specially in urban areas go to rular arears fucking cowrds,negative
let me guess kamala lost and she was ignoring her male co pilot to fight against the patriarchy,negative
helicopter exceeding its height and not following its flight line thats what caused the crash and loss of life being military helicopter well never know the truth rip,negative
it was the helicopter pilots fault its much easier to slow down and maneuver than a plane also having one member to manage flights and heli is a recipe for disasters i hope the family sued everyone involved in the planning stage smh,negative
rest in peace to all the figure skaters and their families,negative
cant see how its not the choppers fault,negative
why do you not report on the serious repeated failures of the woman pilot she was told more than once of the nearing collision and to take action but she did nothing why was her identity concealed for days allowing time to scrub her online footprint officials knew at the instant of the crash who the pilot was why wasnt her name and photo front and center that same day,negative
i see the investigation is complete ive been waiting for so long to find out what actually happened,negative
today airindia flight crashed in ahmadabad after minutes of take off at the moment more than lost their lives now flights are nightmare for me,negative
that was intentional,negative
a little nitpicky but white phosphor nvgs are white not green when you look through them,negative
its so sad to hear what really happened i dont think she crashed on purpose but damn did she make it look like it ignoring other captains ignoring atc flying well above the maximum flight level it certainly seems as if it was intentional i think she just was under qualified so sad may the innocent people on that plane and others in the helicopter rip,negative
just now realizing there is a hotel not to far from the airport they probably heard the crash,negative
military at fault you dont do a training exercise in the path of an active commercial runway dumb asses,negative
it boggles my mind that the military allowed this blackhawk pilot to operate an aircraft when she clearly wasnt capable of doing so in this environment we clearly have a problem either our military instructors are incompetent or they allowed an incompetent pilot to operate an aircraft in an airspace that could cause massive casualties how sad all the way around so many lives lost on that plane due to complete incompetence shameful and disgusting,negative
the fact they even let helicopters fly at the same height as landing planes is insane levels of negligence,negative
reagan national dealing with an atc shortage is just too on the nose reagan does not deserve his name anywhere near an airport after all he did,negative
thank you for this informative video of these heartbreaking tragedies amazing job,negative
god i love how the british speak especially their accent laboreatory,negative
what a coincidence that just happens to be a joe biden lover i believe she had something to do with it and its being covered up to protect the family nobodys talking about it she was pissed off trump just became president they said she deleted all her social media sites before the crash how come,negative
passengers crew pilots one pilot with year job experience second pilot with years experience so twice is or six sixes just a fun observation not that it means anything,negative
dei hire helicopter pilot,negative
caused by a woke dei hire,negative
the dc crash was an incompetent military pilot who had warning about the passenger plane,negative
these arent even investigations its just check out these plane crashes so i can make money you should be ashamed of yourself,negative
worst ad placements on youtube,negative
female pilot low hours flying with nods busy airspace what could go wrong,negative
why does the traffic control not have some sort of uav radar to see that they are both in the same direction,negative
wow the two pilots were experienced that is the most overused term for glazing shit pilots of the time,negative
my friends new a lot of people on that plane,negative
my thing is after a certain hour there are no more flights why couldnt the military wait and do the training exercise from am to am is it that difficult to wait for a couple of hours but also there should be no military airship in the surroundings of an airport with no reason like an emergency or something important a question were the lights from the bk truly off cause thats just another thing that makes my blood boil,negative
with the med jet we dont know yet what made the plane go like that,negative
my mom knew someone on the flight he was a member at her country club coming home from a work trip to see his family and most likely play some golf the next day,negative
the beginning of it all,negative
wow they left out that biden and dei caused this,negative
what they didnt tell you about vfr traffic and atc atc is not responsible for vfr traffic separation they only advise and all advise was ignored by dei pilot,negative
this crash is so indicative of how the government worksthink about that,negative
i guess now we know the truth she wanst skilled enough to be there and flew right into it even with the guy telling her not too,negative
leglima leglima,negative
the girl in the helicopter was a dei hire sounds like she did it on purpose,negative
a terrible tragedy where many children died including a child with his mother from my country,negative
no no no no no thats not what happened she turned into the path of the airliner you can clearly see it there,negative
i have a question why is it allowed to fly a helicopter that is not going to land in the landing corridor of an airport it seems to increase the risk of accidents unnecessarily when a helicopter can very well avoid flying into the landing corridor altogether,negative
its horrific how these lives were lost im not afraid to say it those helicopters pilots are solely responsible for the deaths of everyone on that plane disgusting,negative
alot of dumb decisions were made because dumb people were chosen over competent people these democrats are traitors all of them,negative
according to the new york times the pilot of the black hawk whose name was withheld unusually and who was later described as the third soldier ignored instructions from the assessor to change course they leave this info until the last paragraph make of that what you will,negative
inaccurate upper red strobe on the blackhawk was on and no white lights in the cabincockpit at nightwhen on nvgs also when the hawk was low the crj would have been highlighted against the sky not blending in with the city lights,negative
a,negative
i dunno low light is where they use nightvisionnot in cities where all the lights would render it blinding its for total war at night away from all lights as possible it would be a whiteout within reach of city lights,negative
updat she ignored instructions twice right before the collision she absolutely did it on purpose,negative
i work for psa walked on that plane many times we had to send out the crash bags it was a horrible feeling,negative
the black hawk was seconds away from crossing paths with the jet warrant officer eaves then turned his attention to captain lobach he told her he believed that air traffic control wanted them to turn left toward the east river bank read the nyt report turning left would have opened up more space between the helicopter and flight which was heading for runway at an altitude of roughly feet she did not turn left,negative
ask the israelis mossad,negative
and some how you know,negative
trump is responsible for this thats the only person,negative
there is absolutely no reason why the helicopters should have to fly in between airplanes landing at the runways of any airport let alone in a very busy heavily congested airspace what exactly could they be training for at night to need to use night vision while operating over a busy city with many lights,negative
it is almost a poetic justice that an airport named after the very person who fired thousands of atcs is shortstaffed,negative
when i first heard about this i was adamant this was pre planned,negative
flights like this make me think how uniteds dei hiring makes me never book on them ever again,negative
this story became so conspiratorial before we even knew the victims thank you for documenting what actually happened instead of blindly accusing people of sabotage,negative
and yet trump gutted the air traffic controllers,negative
plane crossed the path of the blackhawk because the blackhawk was not where it was supposed to be,negative
lots of problems changing flight path late changing path w other craft in area other craft in any flight path,negative
why are air ambulances transporting patients to tijuana mexico,negative
so what didnt they tell us but you dont have to tell us this was thrown together in a hurry,negative
blackhawk crew fault,negative
if they didnt tell the public how would you possibly know,negative
why did he change their runway was there a reason for this or was it just on a whim is so that whim cost the lives of many people,negative
was tcas operational on both aircraft,negative
dei female pilot is too blame,negative
why the atc didnt know the altitudes of black hawk n the air craftseriously such avoidable mistake,negative
so what was the great reveal as mentioned in the headline to the story i had heard it all,negative
idk black hawk washington dc time to avoid doesnt make sense,negative
not enough training,negative
my understanding is that the atc has never recovered from ragens firing of the striking controllers i dont feel too comfortable going forward with the trumpdoge team seemingly arbitrarily rifs,negative
masonic number,negative
halm blackhawk crewchief us army retired with over years and hours of flight experience here the first thing i did when i heard of this accident was to look for pictures of the wreckage for the one clue i was dreading to find and i found it yes the altitude was an issue however when we fly at night we typically fly with two crewchiefs in the back one on each side if only one is available we typically have the guy sit on the rightrear seat opposite end of the collision for advisory mainly because the tail rotor is on the right side the left position light is red and the glow of it severely diminishes the ability to see under goggles on the left the right side is the greenblue position light and does not affect the nvgs at all this has been an issues since the nvgs came on the scene yet the military has not bothered to make a permanent change to it to make matters worse the aircraft had wings on it not typical for additional external tanks that wing on the left amplifies and reflects that red light glow back to the left side of the pilots and crews peripheral where the plane came from which drowns out planes lights with the city lights this is why i always mandated that my guys paint the top half of that light cover does not prevent other traffic from seeing you to drastically limit the red light from affecting nvgs of the pilot and crew on the left side if the helicopter needed the wings the wings come with another red light making two red lights we would also paint the top half of that red light as well due to a red haze affect on the left side just past the wing affecting the goggles this has personally helped meus see traffic and obstacles at a greater distance and clarity then an unmodified light unfortunately the investigation team will lock on to the altitudecommunicationroute discrepancies and hang their hat on that as the main causes if you find the pictures or videos online of the helicopter wreckage you will find the wing and the red light fully intact and not modified for nvg flying as mentioned earlier maybe this will finally move the needle and make this modification mandatory in short two left side red lights and no crewchief on the left are in my opinion the main reasons why the plane did not stand out to be seen and was missed by the left side crewpilot,negative
and still more crashes since this video,negative
but guys you didnt actually investigate into the cause of the other crashes,negative
all of the excuses in the world dont play with me that chopper pilot was supposed to be aware of their surroundings at all times and in complete control of it at all times incompetence caused all of those people to lose their lives,negative
no matter how you spin it the helicopterplane crash appears to be obvious pilot error on the part of the helicopter pilot if you are using night vision goggles that restrict your peripheral vision then turn your head side to side until you are out of the danger zone not to mention they were off course and too high seems hard to believe this was anything but pilot error,negative
dei kills helo pilot flying was dei program female pilot,negative
where is the one who got shot by russian,negative
everything was planned and staged to finish someone very important you must look into the list of passengers in that aircraft to get the clue,negative
ironic that it was president ronald reagan who broke the air traffic controllers union by firing all of them when they went on strike due to issues like this and now his name will be forever associated with one of the worst air disasters in history in a way its all his fault,negative
truly sad,negative
i think the helicopter pilots put the wrong atmospheric pressure in the altimeter system or there was water in the tubes causing them to be at wrong altitude,negative
the blackhawk pilot was assigned to the biden administration a month before,negative
tu du du another one bites the dust,negative
i always instruct my fos to dial down the map range lower the map range nm to the lowest possible when cleared for the approach if the psa crew had done this but it is not taught they might of seen the helicopter at a altitude meaning the same altitude as theirs and maybe could of reacted sooner unfortunately these scenarios are never taught in the sim because there is so much to cram into a hour sim session to pass the checkride i have always asked for the sim session to be extended to hours but was denied due to scheduling and budget restraints,negative
no strobe lights on the black hawk i know its animation but it does simulates the real aircracft,negative
the point is that the army heli did not conform to the rules of operation in that corridor i wouldnt blame air traffic control i nearly got killed by a stupid army pilot who disregarded rules regarding the operation of helicopters in ascent that pilot survived my friend and i survived and the army pilot resigned after the incident,negative
this is a st class aircraft piloted by totally professional pilots with more than adequate experience im baffled as to why this happened unless a catastrophic failure of some on board system occurred,negative
wth medical issue do you take a child from the us to tijuana for,negative
im sick of the excuses being made for the planecopter crash it was clearly the armys fault and not having much periphael vision due to wearing night vision just another one i ask you when in the surrounding airspace of any airport does one not make full use of all around vision shouldnt have happend the controller asked them twice they were totally at fault stop making out it was an act of god it wasnt it was a fuck up by the laxidaisical copter crew own it,negative
i never heard of these crashes in the uk but to be fair the donald trump show doesnt leave much time for any other news,negative
some people blamed trump for this,negative
how do you fly half a mile off course and not comply with altitude requirementsand you had this person flying at night the black hawk pilot sounded really incompetent,negative
good illustration,negative
nooo my favourite helicopter,negative
the last crash is horrific imagine youre a passenger looking out the window and seeing sparks next thing you know its darkness they mustve been scared out of their minds,negative
nice work,negative
military practice at night in a busy airport,negative
i like your video but please consider not using dramatic music it only detracts from the narrative,negative
the pilot flying the blackhawk had not flown for two years as she had secured a tour at the white house as a military social aid for the biden administration biden left so did she this is a cool gig because you get to meet all kinds of important people including the president doesnt do anything for your flying skills however particularly currency even if everybody is exactly on course the helicopters are just feet below a jet landing on that runway the faa apparently did nothing with the reports of near misses,negative
the controller buggered up this situation by at the last second changing the key from to he presumably did it to get some more spacing behind the jet for subsequence traffic the jet should have simply landed on as they had been on a precision approach for circling to shift to put them in harms way,negative
trumps doge is to blame,negative
things i noticed no oclock position or distance stated for the crj when asking pat if they had the crj in sight altitude conflict also not mentioned a regular practice i hear in my area whether required or not is tower will typicaly ask both aircraft if they see the other at their respective oclock position in retrospect it would have been zero effort to ask the helo to do a for seperation or simply avoid the approach corridor for runway until further notice or pat climb and maintain until the jet is out of the way etc etc despite pats prompt replies that he had visual of the correct jet it does not seem so on goggles they easily could have seen the crj over the woodrow bridge if they had tracking the jet would have been easy alsoon goggles tcadtcas in both aircraft should have given altitude clues an approaching aircraft is on descent while a departing helo is committed to the lowlevel route altitudes that would not conflict with the inbound crj should and seemingly could have been much easier options to allow these two aircraft flight without conflict may we all live and learn from this catastrophe,negative
no new info waste of time,negative
to the videographer you are mentally ill to need to inappropriately add hollywood fantasy music to this real life tragedy warning must be watched muted because of inappropriate mind numbing vomit inducing background music what is wrong with you people who need your feeble minds constantly inundated with this tweedledee tweedledum ga ga pooh background music,negative
hackers,negative
the female blackhawk helicopter pilot didnt have enough flight hours to be piloting the blackhawk alone she should of had a more experienced pilot on board,negative
much info on the crjblackhawk collision is missing here why the deviation from runway to the deviation is not unusual even though rarely used why is more important at that time this airport has a high rate of jet t help near misses there are established hold points on all the helo routes along the river blackhawks helicopters can and do hover all the time no heads have rolled over these preventable deaths of both civilian and military personnel corrective action on both sides is inconclusive seems to cover both rather than solve the obvious problems,negative
the ntsb recovered the cockpit voice recorder and the enhanced ground proximity warning system because it would give information on flight data not the flight data recorder id have thought that would be more useful,negative
oh they not reveal the mice yet,negative
we will see interesting nothing was said about reagan air traffic controller knocking off early or why helicopter was above their maximum ceiling while just having a training flight more to know the ntb is about the only government agency i still trust,negative
i put the responsibility of the dc midair squarely on the shoulders of the controllers they never gave the pat a clock position for the rj especially when sepatation of the two aircraft became critical they never made the rj crew aware of pat and finally they did not command the rj to go around when conflict alert sounded in the tower controllers exist for aircraft separatoon amd they failed,negative
its a shame joe biden was more interested in dei and not looking for the best for our military her parents scrubbed her online account she was known as an activist for joe biden it show pic of her with him,negative
the blackhawk pilot partime pilot full time social climber didnt comprehend why she had to hug the far bank of land it was to stay under the airplanes glide slope glide slope glide slope copy toss into the mix night vision goggles like a horse with blinders and you have recipe for disaster complacency coupled with pure ignorance tempered with arrogance while most four star generals spend half their lives waxing their corvettes,negative
i cant keep watching this this tragedy didnt have to happen the simple fact that the military would infringe upon civilian airspace is unacceptable period,negative
useless channel,negative
video wont tell black box conversations of helicopter nor lear jethiding real cause of accidents,negative
making comments without properly looking at the outcomes insufficient staff not the main cause,negative
the black helicopter slammed deliberately into the side of the plane i saw it three times and that is the only conclusion i could come up with,negative
the flight path for the blackhawk had seventyfive feet of vertical clearance allowance between its flight corridor and the civilian land approach glide slope what caused this faa extreme incompetence,negative
there is bad communication between the blackhawk and the dispatch tower their training exercise is on the wrong path heading to the dc area airport though the accident could be avoid if the blackhawk pilot is more focus on what is nearby the sky unfortunately a civilian airliner was on the same path intersecting at the same location which cause the midair collision rip to all who perish,negative
when this incident happened and after just reading the news headline i go what the heck is the faa doing allowing both rotary and fixed wing aircraft in the same airspace and especially at night in one of the most congested airspaces in the us,negative
what about the,negative
this crash was because of total incompetence on the part of the black hawk crew there are a hell of alot of other places that the army can do training missions at night instead of a really busy airport,negative
yea you dont put training anything around civilians,negative
the chopper crew along with the tower controller had a death wish for the plane firstly why did he relocate the plane to the part of the chopper secondly those choppers are equipped to detect missiles they didnt detect a passenger planemurder in the first degree,negative
i cant imagine being the only person on my job,negative
there were five people in the tower but only one doing the planes and helicopters the rest were getting paid for nothing i guess the boss had let the helicopter controller go home early,negative
the graphics used in this are incredible this must have been so much work i wonder if they used radar or lidar scanning great job,negative
your animation depicts the crj running into the blackhawk the video clearly shows the blackhawk over taking the crj from the side and atc has nothing to do with this accident the pilot of the blackhawk did not see the crj thats it what we dont need is more incompetent government oversight,negative
have you repented of your sins and vowed to follow jesus we dont know when we will die so be prepared and live for jesus and know if you die you will spend eternity in heaven and not hell,negative
a pilot asking for visual separation and taking responsibility for everyones lives is like a child asking to run across a highway,negative
this is what happens when you layoff resources and expect all work to be done,negative
insane that we have to use an app to tell us which news are credible,negative
a night training mission right in the path of a passenger plane at night what could go wrong with this practice,negative
im not one of those guys but this is getting old its always the training and as we can see the blackhawk helicopter didnt adhere to the altitude and was off their course also seeing the second video released it looks like the helicopter just made a straight line straight to that airplane,negative
military helicopter pilots should undergo situational awareness it looks like safety is not their priority how sad,negative
human error it happens everyday,negative
i find it incomprehensible that two helicopter pilots wearing night vision didnt see a midsized passenger jet crossing their flight path something is not right,negative
tia juana is somebodys aunt in mexico the big city is called tijjuana not tiajuana christ americans cant get these simple things right,negative
so stupid to have helicopters training near a passenger jet and airport inexcusable atc and military need to be disciplined all this time we have people defending the helicopter pilots low time hours and flying too high,negative
error at if chopper is at ft and aircraft is descending from approach altitude the chopper pilots would have been looking up for the aircraft there are no city lights to disrupt vision into a dark sky,negative
how many people think that adam air purposefully litigated the recovery of the boxes so the longer theyre down there the better chance they are destroyed,negative
wenus,negative
adam air ryan air spirit airlinesall bright and flashy all cramped and dangerous,negative
how do a pilot not know that their pilot disengaged with autopilot the warning was very obvious as well,negative
theyre responsible because they doesnt train the pilot on hands training,negative
when people panic they cant think right,negative
yes ful one failure can cause an accident,negative
the maintenance workers nees to be in prisonall the people was killedthey meed to be in prison,negative
those babies,negative
way too many closeups here,negative
i remember when i was still in college aeronautical engineering my lecturer gave us the fdr and cvr transcripts to analyze it after almost week look at both data i remember i was the only one in the class that concluded it was a human error that both pilots focused on performing troubleshooting while one of them shouldve actually fly the plane as mentioned in it was very tragic its the first time all of us heard the actual recording of the cvr which i learned later that it was also spread wildly on the internet and the last words from both pilots really send a chill to the bone,negative
loose regulation in the name of growth leads to death and disaster,negative
the pilots did not know what they were doing did they have any experience training were they actually trained pilots,negative
could be the same for malaysian airlines same situation,negative
but how did the flight go off course,negative
mayday air destaster channel is excellent highly recommend for a insight to what can happen and how excellent the investigators are,negative
the situation was overwhelming for the crew instrument failure plus navigation mistake plus tempest if they dont get the proper training to reset the system under these circumstances its nearly impossible to get out of here thats why former military pilots deal generally better with these kind of cases mr lionel ramsal from kalukra,negative
reminds me of frontier and spirit airlines now and how they run their business,negative
a simple water based inclination instrument analogue as spare to the electronics one would be highly recommended dear airbus boeing,negative
,negative
the only mistake and a major one on the part of pilots was they didnt trust their flying skills over the machine systems,negative
adam air months after the crash be like dow alright is diabolical,negative
frans wenus,negative
its not a pilot problem its an aeroplane technical issue all the responsibilities are going to be aeroplane authorities,negative
is this channel a subsidiary of national geographic cos film making amd narration are very much similar,negative
i didnt know the irs had another name besides the internal revenue service,negative
i hate when i knew there always humans error with airplane crashed its always peoples not bc the plane itself p of sht,negative
the aircraft is designed to roll to the right wow thats a big design flaw,negative
seriously asking in this kind of situation was it possible to do correction if the pilot experienced enough,negative
they tried to served the video presentable and polite the truth is they kept an urge to angry and disappointed about the adamair company practice and how agung laksono and sandra ang the company owner deliberately ignoring the plea of family in the accident to pay the search and resulting how dangerously government and businesses owner corruption level that significantly depopulate indonesian by their practice dont try to dive deeper to even the disastrously mining of lapindo sidoarjo that causing the eastern part of java island sunk in dangerous volcanics mudflow,negative
he was going to my hometown manado also someone at a small village named koreng founded some of the passengers of adam air flight,negative
f,negative
lessons from flight,negative
no no plane,negative
who put manny pacquaio in charge of the plane,negative
bright colours and flashy uniforms dont make a good airline,negative
see i told you it was a rerun,negative
hey hi everyone i am near versailles france watching these air tragedies mayday is the best spot in social media well documented thank you,negative
appalled at amount of ads every mn another frustrating channel,negative
asians are not known for their common sense,negative
adam air was purchased directly from temu,negative
there is really no other reason for any air disaster but money and greed whatever the immediate cause there is always money as underlying cause when there is a technical issue like here you will find saving and cutting corners in maintenance or parts when its human error you will find tired crew that flies too many hours lacks training lacks more crew to handle complex tasks etc when its storms you will find pressure to be on time and not wait and lose money even if its unsafe when its a controller you will find control towers understuffed and overworked its always greed and money,negative
not only did they fly on a discount airline but it seemed like they got discount pilots obviously they were skilled enough to get the plane in the air,negative
,negative
wow very incompetent pilot and co pilot i blame them for the loss of all those people,negative
god bless all those beautiful people,negative
asian driver,negative
why is everyone surprised i mean it is indonesia i wouldnt be caught dead in that muslim and catholic country,negative
they were panicking too cant blame them though,negative
if technology falls no one can improve it because now technology falls and in the future even worse because it is almost the end of the world and before the end of the world comes nothing in this world will work and everything will come to a standstill,negative
im so sad bcs theres a baby on adam air,negative
wait a sec what backasswards country was this at where the govt officials and the owner of a commercial airline both stall on a major airline disaster for some some mos while they argue about whos supposed to pay for the recovery omg please remind me never to visit that part of the globe ever unbelievable smh ps isnt that part of the globe where the malaysian plane disappeared well in their defence seems that airline did try hard with a decent proper recovery effort rip,negative
adam air when you fly you will meet adam in heaven,negative
as i expected this airline was led by a chinese who made her year old son the ceo as anybody knows chinese dont give a crap about safety hygiene maintenance just make more money,negative
with the advanced technology in todays world how about the black boxes directly downloading in real time to a remote server you know how our phones are tracked and servailed daily,negative
yup you know its real bad if the flight simulation is quick and there are no interview sections,negative
hilarious that companies are fighting who should pay when finding is the key and the quicker the better,negative
widodo,negative
gak ngerti bahasa inggreesss,negative
i remember that exact day my mother also on board of adam air but different route from bali to bandung but to hear that adam air was missing my grandfather frantically called us is it the same plane my mother took well of course not but still we mourned for the deceased may they all rest in peace may allah hold their souls dear in his paradise aamiin,negative
jesus turn off autopilot and turn around fix location later,negative
damnnow yall add screaming kids too stop already,negative
weenus,negative
this is one of the most interesting and complex investigation of an accident that i have ever seen,negative
this plane had a natural tendency,negative
they should first learn pilots to fly during their training because the current generation of pilots cannot fly at all and are essentially very vulnerable as it specialists and bad pilots with a few exceptions almost all plane accidents are human errors and there is a clear reason for this when you carefully consider all these fatal accidents they cannot fly at all the current generation of planes are controlled by computers and pilots are therefore also trained accordingly this means that in the event of computer failure they do not react instinctively like a real pilot a training also only takes about years and is accessible to almost everyone despite the costs that are easily financed by banks in the form of a loan the largest part of the training consists of theory and simulator training and there is very little real flying involved,negative
imagine being adam,negative
hey its the actor that played the captain of egyptair,negative
two idiot pilots one should fly the plane the other should of refused the atc directions to fly into the storm they should of asked for a turn then the co pilot should clear the nav and put in new coordinates from where they are then to where they need to go then figure out fuel if they can make it then watch for any problems to occur with the nav computer this is better then to try and figure out where it went wrong once they get back on track the copilot can try and figure that out latter if they have time,negative
this airplane like an old car has a tendency to roll to the right without autopilot the aileron goes to the neutral position and the plane is rolling with all due respect to the channel what is that mean so during the takeoff this plane would always roll to the right it makes no sense unless there was another malfunction that was causing the roll,negative
why did they allow the plane to take off when there is a storm,negative
pilot vs instrument babysitter they had no clue how to fly that plane,negative
they picked two grest actors for the pilots they are pkaying the two dummies perfectly i almost hated them for portraying ignorance so well,negative
reminds me of eastern airlines crashed because autopilot was accidently shut off without the pilots noticing while they were investigating what turned out to be a faulty landing gear indicator,negative
if the navigation is off fly the plane manually and if you cant even fly a plane to the nearest airport then you shouldnt fly a plane,negative
honestly at least it didnt turn into mh,negative
adam was personally jesus christ the son of god who was caught when he took the apple from the tree his name is jesus amadeus yepi,negative
what i find the most interesting is that unlike the other adam plane these guys had atc even if you completly have no idea of where you are aviate comes first but these guys had a way of finding and fixing their position atc already confirmed they had the radar position at worst they would had to land but in fixing an issue that wasnt life threatening they created a fatal issue and thats where exactly the training comes in which they werent given,negative
i bet adam air delayed payment for the salvage in hopes the data recorder and voice recorders would be damaged so they could avoid being held accountable,negative
adam air should have been forced to pay for the whole search not to help pay for it,negative
so sad that all this had to happen and people had to lose their lives,negative
unbelievable that the indonesian government did nothing until adamair paid for the search cowboy airline cowboy maintenance cowboy training cowboy government flying indonesian airlines is not recommended,negative
fool pilots were recruited they thought the plane will run on autopilot,negative
what i dont get and is not explained is how all the passengers are fully aware of being turned over like an omelette in a washing machine and glasses of water crashing on to the floor where as the pilots are not aware of the bank angle changed explain please,negative
only to go down after all months really,negative
the airline really treated plane maintenance like how it tech support fixes a desktop thats not working poweroff blow off the dust from the plugplay components and then its good to go,negative
excessively ambitious people wanting to feel important about the idea of creatingowning an airline though it means doing so on a shoe string leasing planes with only the bare minimum in the bank are in a precarious situation if they dont keep their planes full of passengers invariably they start running out of money and cant afford to maintain their fleet to the highest standards its a recipe for disaster as it was in this case the management comes under intense pressure which then filters down through the entire organisation creating an unstable work place its better to pay more and fly on well established airlines that have good cash reserves because they are safer and if you cant afford to fly with the likes of emirates then go without buyer beware,negative
beware of budget airlines who cut corners because they are underfunded,negative
these pilots are not trained to fly an airliner just button pushers let the computer fly the plane then you got another boeing aircraft that doesnt function properly,negative
frontier spirit and allegiant dont look so bad now huh,negative
it should be mandatory that the airlines have to pay for the salvage operation of their planes or else their license is revoked entirely until they do when we pay to fly we are paying for those planes to be in good working order and to be properly maintained and staffed by a competent enough crew to fly from point a to b cheaper shouldnt mean cutting corners or pilots lacking basic training if the seats are slightly uncomfortable or theres no food or drinks offered or if the overall plane is cramped thats fine but the absolute number one priority is that the planes should be safe and in good order with capable staff not only should the airline pay for the salvage operation so should the manufacturer of the plane if nothing else they made it so if there is any possible way the crash is attributed to the planes design which has been the case for many crashes they should also be held liable and if proven to be not at fault they can sue the airliner for their cut of the salvage cost back but either way if a plane crashes it should be an absolute certainty that there will be at least a one week salvage operation paid for at the expense of the airline and manufacturer,negative
i swear you always give us what happens to the planes in each video at the very starting of each and every one of these videos and we are still yet confused until we find what actually happened ive only been watching your vids for days crazy,negative
terribly sad my deceased bother and sil both were airline mechanics over years and over years both proud to say no plane they ever worked on had any major issues of course their company american airlines made sure they had all they needed to do their jobs may all rip,negative
so can someone please explain to me the difference in importance bw ferry survivors airplane survivors im sure the ferry survivors families are elated that they were found,negative
dan satusatunya kecelakaan pesawat di indonesia yang rekaman black boxnya bocor ke publik bahkan diputar di tv swasta sebagai bahan pemberitaan,negative
minutes in what is going on in that cockpit,negative
their slogan was fly is cheap but it should have been life is cheap,negative
pilot error maintenance problems and greed caused everything to fall apart rip to victims feeling sorry for the loved ones of victims,negative
are these people for real poor aviation,negative
im not an engineer but why dont aircraft have a simple bubble level on the dashboard it would show the air crew whether the plane is in level flight or rolling to the left or the right,negative
a malfunctioning irs who knew,negative
yes it is tragic that adam airs crash resulted in indonesias isolation from the european union but what i find it more disappointing is that the european ban is still in effect even after indonesia reformed its budget airline industry as a panasian maybe an indonesian retaliatory ban on european airlines would be wise and nationalist,negative
i cant believe after this crash part pilot error or not that they continued to not take seriously the maintenance of those planes the disrespect showed to victims and their families is so unacceptable here i cant believe any pilot or cabin crew flew again with them and i cant believe after being public knowledge that they didnt want to assist with the plane recovery that memeber of the public ever booked a flight again also for them to have another crash after this one they should of been grounded after the first one the replay of what it was like onboard is horrifying and sad beyond belief to think those poor passengers and the sound of kids and babies crying is heartwrenching try not use so much image of baby passengers and that sound in the videos rip to all those victims nobody should have to go through that,negative
crookshanks and weenus is diabolical,negative
too many pilots rely almost exclusively on the computers and auto pilot it could come in handy at some point to know how actually fly the plane by your own merit,negative
the australia air safety board was asked to assist the ntsb because malaysia wouldnt trust the ntsb to prove that the ntsb werent biased,negative
tunnel vision,negative
wtf why is it necessary to run ads every minutes then add yt ad testing bs mayday channel,negative
corrupted konoha gov,negative
in england when a person wants to tell another person to come and visit them sometime they say next time youre in town come knock me up sometime i guess the british know that in the us knock me up means something completely different,negative
by the way guys your narrator as you call him is a computer generated voice with an english accent and checked many times over for mistakes i love when they say shedule,negative
its an absolute disgrace that adam air didnt want to pay that money was put in front of people they also knew that the beakens only lasted days,negative
how do idiots like this become pilots isnt there anyone in the airlines to find and fire idiots governments should be able to ban irresponsible companies,negative
well its yujang made my day,negative
a cheapass company and a lameass captainthe same recipe for plane and ship disasters they dont learn,negative
the airline got tons of reports about the failing system and did nothing sure there was a lot of human error here but if they just replaced the irs this wouldve never happened my gpu is artifacting and failing i know a fix clean the desktop case,negative
at the minute seconds mark i recognized a dire straits private investigation sound like bite,negative
why isnt the telemetry data live streamed to satellites versus being on a physical box in the fucking plane,negative
what a goat rope of a company and country the government had the ability to pull the ticket of the airline for failing to pay for the salvage of the boxes instead they negotiated for months shame on both how many other lives couldve been lost in that time,negative
the government should allow overseas staff and administrators to operate the airport itself that people are clueless,negative
one of the most corrupt countries in asia no surprises watching this,negative
couldnt have found a more incompetent crew if they tried,negative
they landed in sumba just with eye,negative
at least three different shots of the one investigator drinking water why,negative
bi,negative
i wa a europen pilot iin indonesia for years in the s and we flw everwhere and had so many incidents money more important wrote an interesting boo on subject safety little importance sdomeu z,negative
indonesia no thanks,negative
say what ever you want abaut ryanair their safety is impecable,negative
the way i see it the upper management and owner with their history of cuuting corners and not caring about flight safety they got away with mass murders,negative
welp bro forgot that the autopilot was disconnected when he said it was disconnected,negative
how do u mess up that badly bro went north,negative
im guessing the imu gyro package was damaged,negative
my brother and my high school math teacher were on that plane i was on that flight as well but i was one of the lucky ones who made it out alive also my friends stepdad was the pilot and his uncle was the copilot and i should also mention that the atc person working that day was actually my next door neighbors cousin,negative
ive watched several of these terrific episodes but i am puzzled in case the instruments dont work and you fear getting disoriented why dont planes put on a simple carpenters level that will tell you immediately if you are level in all three axis it seems to be foolproof to me and may have prevented some of these disasters,negative
every time pilots put the autopilot on they dont get experience flying and navigating the airplane those hours should not b counted as experience since they get no experience pilots dont know how to read the gagues bc when the autopilot fails they get extremely upset and are unable to fly the plane autopilot should be banned from airplanes bc pilots dont know how to fly the planes bc they dont have the experience needed when something goes wrong if the autopilot system wasnt on the plane everyone would be alive just like with so many other crashes people would be alive if there wasnt autopilot on the plane this happens over and over and over bc of pilots not flying the planes and not paying attention to gagues constantly which is the cause of so many deathsautopilot should be illegal so the passengers would be far far more safe,negative
the baby guys,negative
when your instruments go out cant you use a glass of water in place of an artificial horizon you do not trust,negative
orange huh grim same color as flight data and pilots voice recorders,negative
i remember watching this episode on tv and commenting that that wasnt a realistic cockpit and none of the alarms sounded like boeings years later watching it on youtube i still think the cockpit is unrealistic but now its somehow nostalgic,negative
the salvage operation is remarkable to find both boxes in all that water,negative
worst airline and worst crew uniform,negative
both pilots were checking the weather or gps no one was flying the plane thats dangerous,negative
surely a simple spirit level in the cockpit would save all of these similar occurrences,negative
any and all pilots should go through a mandatory training program to stop this from happy,negative
its so sad,negative
shame on that storm sunk a ship and downed a plane,negative
its an model for pilots mistakes,negative
why did pilots ignore system warnings,negative
boieng not safe,negative
very educative,negative
but why isnt there any mention about mcas,negative
boeing didnt the foresee the potentially deadly affect of a faulty altimeter you have got to be kidding prima facie absurd,negative
thousands of reported failure of the radio altimeter and no fix was found and now its up to pilots to react properly because things are gonna breakon an airplane what kind of safety culture is that,negative
it was a serious malfunction of a component which is boeings responsibility telling the pilots that they didnt pay attention is a way to avoid their problem with the design and the electical components,negative
and we all know now how those improvements by boimg have turned out rip passengers and crews killed by boing,negative
imho the most important automation is the inclusion of a ill take it from here button to give pilots complete and unrestricted autonomy of the aircraft,negative
one of the boeing guys on the flight must have hinted they were going to snitch lol,negative
luckly not fire after crash,negative
these investigations start with finding faults in humanspilots try thier best then they try maintenance and lastly if not even a slightest of blame can be put upon these two they ask the manufacturer to look intokudos to thier trust in machines,negative
it was a stall,negative
or mayby it was a stall,negative
common the altimeter has been wrong for ever and the accident is the pilots fault thats ridiculous altimeter must be correct at any time no complacency can be tolerated on an instrument controlling auto throttle on landing not only the aircraft manufacturer is responsible for the deaths but the investigation agency is absolutely corrupt to conclude otherwise it was obviously a catastrophe in waiting and it happened of course what a shame,negative
this is a clear capitan error loads of signals to save this happening and capitan failed reading the numerous warnings really sad,negative
boeing is a murderer,negative
who knows this boeing fault is the reason for air india crash as well,negative
they should have never landed ifr with a bad ra,negative
death comes without warning what is meant to happen will happen no one can stop this its a fact no matter how science is advanced these incident will happen only thing can save you is the almighty be religious and be good,negative
the rd pilot who was observing should have known and told both the captain and the first officersince the first officer was in training plus pilots and anyone working with automation should be heavily trained on knowing that the automation is doing what its supposed to all these crashes should be part of every airlines training and how often should pilots be retrained so as to not have these things happen,negative
typical boeingblame dead pilots for your own garbage part then they killed hundreds more with another bs hidden computer that overrides pilots in their dreamliner,negative
petot tube failiure on pilot side also caused a crash in south america why boeing didnt change their configuration on autopilot after this,negative
wondering how the plane didnt caught fire by falling,negative
an idiotic map on which vojvodina and kosovo are separated from their mother country of serbia how did you not separate a province in germany england or spain,negative
if its boeing i am not going,negative
ras parts swap failure inventory mistakes,negative
sonar code compare fault,negative
met gordon bethune in elmhurst sedor must be busy this annum,negative
state of the art and boeing in a sentence is an oxymoron,negative
how does something work if its not working properly,negative
more boeing junk software,negative
this plane technology should be made so simple that even a child could fly it it is only then that airways could become purely safe more complex the system more chances of human errors,negative
even in these planes are falling no improvements,negative
i quit after minutes too long,negative
waiting for ahmedabad ai episode true facts in the episode,negative
boeing only,negative
ignorant kapten reset multiple warnings,negative
boeing was my favourite but seems it cannot be trusted anymore,negative
same same one ive watched,negative
pilots should not be expected to compensate for shortcomings they are expected to fly a plane in good condition not fix the consequences of a faulty flight altimeter,negative
the third pilot shouldve noticed,negative
my understanding is if they hadnt used ils landing and the captain landed it manually at their final approachdescent this crash wouldnt have happened,negative
botim line is that all these ecperts are giving clearance to the manufacturer ailine blaming only pilots since there was so many complains about this issue in other planes,negative
boeing is a joke,negative
i think it wasnt a microburst like in india crashenginesfailed,negative
this is a totall disaster ive been a pilot for years i am still active to this day if this was my plane nobody l mean nobody would have a scrath on them these pilots need a stern talking to,negative
if its boeing i aint going,negative
i cannot believe that the computer does not issue an unmistakable verbal warning that a major flight configuration is about to be made there probably also should be some sort of required response from the pilots that indicate the pilot concurs with the configuration change before it can take place a visual warning on a set of busy cockpit instruments does not seem to me to be adequate,negative
wow the autopilot really does not like the crew,negative
i just knew that boeing is the culprit the recent ahmedabad crash would be the airlines fault too the company has gone woke,negative
never take boeing,negative
very educative,negative
i watched this after air india boeing crash,negative
why are ther americen sirens in the sound overlay in the first minutes instead of the very different dutch,negative
after the air india which was an boeing dreamliner i will never an abroad that flight,negative
american aircrafts are not at all safe,negative
and boeing crashes again in india soon after take off,negative
there is no pilot error in this,negative
however boeings disaster never stopped,negative
this shows the quality of boeing aircraft,negative
its about time to install ai to take over on these situations and recover the plane when pilots are making lots of mistakes that lead to this kind of accident,negative
instead pf blaming the pilots why not blame boeing for delivering nonsense faulty planes,negative
air india crash yesterday,negative
sir next investigation on air india accident on june,negative
boeings conclusion on the radio altimeter failures is alarming not knowing why they fail is unacceptable you made the system you need to figure that out and then to say its not that dangerous is also unacceptable but also how do you forget to fly the plane,negative
if its a boeing im not going,negative
mayday air disaster please there is a terrible airplane crash that happened in india today the can you do well to make a video on it and tag me whenever you posts it,negative
rest in peace,negative
i am sorry to say you also lack professionalism turkish airline tk what is the date of the crash not mentioned anywhere in the whole video your video is dated may rd thats all my point is whether this crash happened before max fiasco with mcas or later you will not understand but it is very important,negative
so the solution would appear to be dont buy boeing planes but on a serious note surely the solution is to program the autopilot for each airport approach for example if a plane regularly flies from ema east midlands airport in the uk to amsterdam then surely you can program the autopilot for each of the airports approach as each one will be slightly different in theory this would make the flights more consistent and actually speed up the flights and reduce delays,negative
i am turkish look istanbul is not hard to type,negative
the mcdonnell douglas parasites that took over boeing along with the state department convinced netherlands to downplay manufacturing and engineering faults and to place blame on pilots,negative
not a threat to safety,negative
stop publishing this shoddy investigations,negative
im glad they included the pretty blond woman who contributes absolutely nothing and never speaks,negative
this documentary tells me being a pilot is not an easy task but a rocket science,negative
why spoken in thepresent tensethe plane fell,negative
is it a case of ai going wrong,negative
donkey turks,negative
big lies fuel for air jet engines never say ebolth engine oil air jet engine can not work with out engine oil,negative
so all i observed from seeing this series that boing aircraft is tendency to go down,negative
another fear added while flyngmicro burst,negative
shut it off and fly the jet what an original idea no offense but i agree that monitoring should be the computer and flying should be more the pilot i liked hearing that also the pilots i dont think were aware of the physical fix hto such a problem,negative
i did not know mark from peep show worked as a documentary narrator,negative
the gauges need tick tock brain rott to play in the background,negative
why warning sound of air speed low its not sound perhaps by the sound can more alert the pilot im pilot my self the importance is even the pilot fly in automation keep monitoring the progress of the flight phase by phase especially during approach to land phase so technology and pilot can interact precisely the most important things a ove all keep bare in mind and scann the speed the most and fly the aircraft,negative
it was the landing gear please captain understand what im saying and just put the landing gear dumb dumb,negative
very good explanation,negative
manufacturer incompetent careless on safety could and should have prevented the accidents with right brains executing corrections in time,negative
most of these craahes are caused by the sketchy pilots trained in corrupt countries where diplomas are bought turkey indonesia venezuela etc or by woke hired tower control us,negative
wow boeing cutting corners whod a thunk obvious sarcasm,negative
when the plane went into retaedshould have been a loud warning,negative
why cant they put small windows in the cockpit by their feet so they can see the ground better,negative
times they shouldve stopped flying for right now till they figured it out but thats money lost i guess,negative
this why i clap after every flight flying a plane and everything that comes with it isnt easy i hope my pilot would question every sound that alarms,negative
geez a slamdunkawful,negative
a the new york times investigation found that the dutch investigation into the crash either excluded or played down criticisms of boeing following pressure from boeing and us federal safety officials who instead emphasized pilot error as a factor rather than design flaws,negative

noooo my friends cousin was one of the pilots,negative
on no the airplane just burst into flames because the engine,negative

you see this is the reason i keep my but on the ground,negative
you mean they had to do a checklist before they open the doors and let those people out after that plane was on fire that doesnt make any sense,negative
im confused number there was no ending,negative
like a full hollywood production very suspenseful,negative
whyd they just cut it and not enplained what happened,negative
is this really real,negative
too fat person really dangerous for the engine the airline or government show check this issue too many airplane accidents this days example one seat kgkg per person over until kg extra fee over kg two seat pay ver kg three paid good business for the company business more safety for all passengers of the airplane its no discrimination its for safety policy also should be check no too many seats on the airplane passengers need to check online the model of the airplane and why have so many seats,negative

im from pittsburgh and im surprised flight isnt included here if i remember correctly and please correct me if im wrong the documentary i watched said it was the first crash site to be declared a biohazard it hit nose down at miles an hour and there were just pieces of people everywhere in the wreckage on the ground in the treesso splattered around that the investigators couldve been coming into contact with biological material without even realizing it i cant recall any other crash sites ever being described in such extreme and graphic detail,negative

im already terrified of flying even though my parents always used to take me as a kid twice a year without fail one long hall flight holiday to the likes of africakenya cuba antigua st lucia dominican republic venezuela goa thailand mexico brazil maltaetcsome of these destinations more than once like kenya times to name a few one short hall flight holiday like to spain multiple times canary islands egypt cypress tunisia ibiza multiple times these are just examples to show that im not a novice flyeri was never bothered as a kid teenager growing up flying abroad was just a normal thing to me i think the fear of flying began to start just after happened even tho im from the uk i developed a habit of watching multiple episodes of air crash investigationon discovery channel which obviously didnt help lol i used to have dreamsnightmares that i was in a plane crash didnt or more like wouldnt fly for quite sometime even with people presenting me with the statisticfact that theres supposedly more chance of you dying in a car crash than a plane crash but even that was no comfort or took away the fear of flying i used to go to ibiza sometimes twice in the summer even that stopped for a while but fortunately i managed to take the leap fly to ibiza last yeari was terrified of course but i did it lol thats something i wish to do again sometime soon,negative

last thing you want to hear is the captain sayingwhats this,negative
you guys know these are fake right,negative
what is it with all the ads one every minute screw this im not watching,negative

he looks like the news guys from the simpsons,negative
are they real plane crash,negative
scary,negative
great video i really appreciate the effort put into the storytelling and visuals but honestly i think some of these incidents are more about sensationalism than educating the public on aviation safety what do you all think,negative
this video is incredibly well put together and it really sheds light on some tragic events however i cant help but feel that showcasing these disasters might glamorize the severity of air travel risks its important to remember the real lives affected behind these incidents what do u all think,negative
jim tit ball,negative
i really enjoyed this video the production quality is topnotch and its fascinating to see how far safety has come however i cant help but think that focusing on air disasters glorifies the tragedy instead of just learning from it what do you all think,negative
this is such a wellcrafted video and i really appreciate the research that went into it however i cant help but feel that focusing solely on air disasters might sensationalize tragedies that should be treated with more sensitivity theres so much to learn from aviation safety advancements and maybe that angle could get more attention instead what do you think,negative
really enjoyed this video the production quality is topnotch and its fascinating to see how far aviation safety has come but honestly i cant help but think that focusing so much on air disasters might sensationalize events that are after all quite rare what do you all think,negative
what a fascinating video really enjoyed the insights you provided but i gotta say it seems like some of these air disasters get way more attention than others that deserve it too like why do some tragic incidents get overshadowed while others become iconic feels a bit unfair dont you think,negative
great video and really well put together i appreciate the effort that said its kinda surprising to see how some of these incidents are still so frequently discussed i kinda feel like focusing on the technical aspects and safety improvements would be more beneficial than reliving such tragedies what do you all think,negative
watching it makes my heart skip a beat so dramatic,negative
when will the planes alarm say my plane my controls,negative
this just motivate me to be pilot,negative
this is the captain your destination is final you paid for your tickets but you are now also paying with your lives dont worry about your luggage and smoke if you got em lol,negative
no one is talking about the nationair one that was crazy,negative

you are so right its the passengers fault,negative

its amazing fascinating and engaging,negative

im waiting to board too,negative
captain sully is a legand,negative
mr presley looks like kevin from the office,negative
ive read the safety card too many times because i was just bored and didnt know what to do lol,negative
does anyone remember the germanwing flight,negative
all it takes is a flaw in one of the materials used in the making of the airplane one mistake by a mechanic weather related issue or a mistake by a pilot and life ends and its all human related it amazes me that the ntsb then analyses every broken piece and puts what left back together to figure out what caused the crash even if those pieces are at the bottom of the ocean incredible dedicated work,negative
just looks like the american airways under the trump administration,negative
that one plane crash went over lanes of moving cars and didnt hit one car then it hit the none moving cars rip,negative
the disrespect to the crew of the gimli glider not making this top right up there with sully,negative
in the one the airplane the pilot fell when he was climing out that look painfull but were was the other pilot,negative
plane has been on fire for close to mins and none of any fire truck are seen arrived,negative
doesnt that look like john cena,negative
that only woman thats sayibg bent downnn bent downnn her nit even scared to,negative
hours by higher bothers slowed,negative
reacting feels bit off tho,negative
some pilots are lethal suicidal or incompetent makes you wonder,negative
well i guess there was a terrorist on that plane and his name is el batouti he disconnected the autopilot for no reason and then proceeded to push the column forward lowered the elevator panels and pulled the throttels back cut off the power to the engine and plunged the airplane downi guess that can definitely be called an elevator problemyeah a human one he did not call for help he did not answer any questions when the first pilot returned to his seat and then did not work together with the pilot to save the plane the first pilot pulling back on the elevator column while el batouti boycotted those measures by pushing forward on the column to bring the plane downhow else can you interpret that behaviour its not suicide true its called murder no matter how they try to deny it el batouti purposely brought that airplane down,negative
,negative
its not suicide but act of terror,negative
translates as he deliberately crashed the plane,negative
extraordinary still for today in the historyrepeatsitself genre air india malaysia mh follow the same script of militant denial by whole countries and many aviation unionsexperts the difference now is the countries keep ntsb at arms length so facts can be hidden the late pilot suicide author william langewiesche is young man here with role to conduct simulator studies for this case somebody needs to fill williams shoes and document the new denials,negative
this one and malaysia are covering up period,negative
overly insisting on flying early the ramblings about his god and not answering his peer officerwhat more do we need here and dont forget the professionals who stated there was no need to switch off the fuel,negative
disgusting behaviour of if an individual who should never been allowed to fly then a face saving denial is an insult to the families,negative
el bhatoutys behaviour was altogether strange and would of course suggest suicide by plane which has happened before,negative
the culture among egyptian pilots at the time is one of semigods and suicide is not accepted in muslim culture so egyptians will always look for mechanical defect rather than pilot defects,negative
i wont eat first and come back to take the con ill get my food tray and take the con while im eating,negative
weird this is the same production as the mayday episode but different edit and narrator i guess they mustve bought the rights to the footage cause its not as good as their normal episodes,negative
did he really say no one believes muslims commit suicidei am speechless in the irony of this statement and especially by doing so with a plane,negative
to almost anyone who weighs the all the extensive existing evidence albatouti was guilty of killing all those people in the taking of his own life and that of a perceived enemy egyptair did pay damages to the victims families my dna profile says i have a small percentage of arabic blood and i am sensitive to and respect arab world concerns and ambitions but in this case i am reminded of a greiving mother whos son is alleged to have done something terrible that we have all seen numerous times in life she will always believe in her sons innocence no matter what the evidence no matter what the facts i can sympathize with that kind of undying immovable faith but sometimes it is delusional and denial suicide is highly stigmatized in egypt so it is feared that it is highly under reported suicides were reported in for instance so it does happen but the number per year is believed to be considerably higher there might be such disgrace and shame brought upon a family that it would probably never ever be admitted to or believed that a family member could commit such a disgraceful act but even the numbers out of egypt do document that it does happen however less frequently than the rest of the world it might be believed to be,negative
muslims dont commit suicide terrorist pilots here hold my flight controls,negative
it could have really been suicide because taking ones own life is a mental dysfunction and considering the pilots predicament he might have lost it at the spur of the moment,negative
,negative
bro the captain started this job when the co pilot is born,negative
brainwashing capacity of islam is the reason,negative
there are so many things here to refute any defense of elbatouti first there is no reason to use his family who of course will never admit he did this regardless of proofs second using the religion thing to rationalize he could not do this is pathetic if not laughable when all you have to do is recite the numbers third the pilot who was sure he did this was so fearful of the consequences of him exposing aelbatouti all he knew was enough to make him move to britain fourth related to number two amazing that it was islamic radicals who assassinated their own president anwar elsadat in guess we dont need to bring up hundreds of other cases do we fifth the fact he recited the religous phrases repeatedly is similar to what suicide bombers do just before detonation the fact he said he needed his son to help him carry the tires could have been a total ruse to throw off investigators not to mention that there is no reason he could not have made an impulsive decision anytime after that the ntsb is probably the worlds foremost experts in air investigations which is why they are called upon so often in things outside the usa so when they met roadblocks in eygypt its obviously because they and their airlines dont want themselves smeared if you want a comparison in a similar situation where nobody tried to stop exposing the truth look at germanwings flight,negative
despicable cowardly act by the first officer murdering everyone on board and committing suicide,negative
these egyptians are delusional theyre as delusional as the democrats in the united states no matter how bad you want something to not be true it dont change the fact that it is true that man killed himself and everybody on that plane even a blind man could see that,negative
well as they say in the show believe it or not he had this planned all along mental health i think is a very big factory,negative
dude why are they defending the suicide freak,negative
denial of usa that it is responsible for the disaster the plane was attacked by missiles and the poor captain was attempting to go up and down to survive the attack trying to cover that is shameful,negative
i was a month into marine corps bootcamp when this happened where were you,negative
even the complaint by the egyptian air officials is posturing since they refused to provide the full information required to do a comprehensive investigation batouty was coddled and deferred to if the original copilot had stayed in control none of these people would have died batouty knew what he would do when he insisted on taking over,negative
something far wrong with a pilot who relies on god,negative
dude crashed the plane,negative
moral if the story never board a plane flown by any chuslim these jihadist are trying to kill us,negative
it seems to me highly likely that the kind of high level corruption that you see in this documentary which was going on in middle eastern countries like egypt at that time reveals the cause of the arab spring that would come around a decade later the corruption in our country that is at least as bad may end up causing a similar rebellion eventually,negative
he did it in the name of religion my family went to egypt in and found that country awful in everyway,negative
imagine a corrupt nation trying to block an investigation sounds like biden,negative
imagine culture over safety,negative
that nephew is a quack he just dont to believe his pervery uncle flipped out and murdered all those people,negative
the man was obviously havng some kind of breakdown and he had one in the cockpit hiss behaviour was completely unacceptable it was a symptom of his failing mind,negative
a lot of s in here captain was flying for years copilot was years old plane fell from ft and the debris field was sq miles,negative
muslims dont commit suicide,negative
hey egypt it was a suicide mission,negative
they say its not in their culture to commit suicideremember theres a first time for everythingalso what about suicide bombers,negative
so this batouty character was just a fanatically religious murderously insane weirdo,negative
good question why why did the airline allow it go on when they knew he had a problem and why did the egypt president not want the fbi to investigate further,negative
it was suicide the question is was it some religious vendetta or some personal nonsense i believe his personal behavior got him into trouble he wasnt going to get out of and he knew it could destroy him and his career,negative
how stupid to tell him it was his last flight a pilots mindset is very important,negative
ads every mins wtf,negative
wont fly egyptian airlines ever egyptian airlines pilots are not enough trained in,negative
egyptian airlines is shit very rude disgusting service still on even in inside airport,negative
just a disgusting old man who didnt care about anyone but himself,negative
what a selfish act even youre a religious person or always present every sunday in the church it doesnt mean youre a good personrip too all the soul who died on that plane,negative
i am watching this because im egyptian,negative
anybody defending him knows they are lying and should be absolutely ashamed of themselves,negative
how anyone like this emotionally unbalanced sexually unstable deviant like this el patooty character was ever given permission to fly a commercial airline is just beyond comprehension and scary whats even more scary is how egypt tried covering the murderous actions of this lose canon goof up,negative
he purposely crashed the plane smh,negative
respect to the cameraman who survived all these chrashes,negative
everyone that believes in god really seems to not want to see him,negative
the commander shift in chernobyl was the same type of guy like this year old captain people with behaviour and personality issues and the need of total control over the others and the situation all the time no matter the logic or consequences the just need to get it their way those people put on an important job are proven to be extremely dangerous and unable to prevent fatal outcome dont hire them please,negative
in the name of god,negative
tyres example by lawyer is bs this is exactly wht you will do if you dnt want it to look like a sucide but legal system all our the world is blind and so much ignorant,negative
i sure miss bill clinton but not much,negative
not surprised that it was a muslim who crashed the plane deliberately never let a muslim to fly a plane he was a womaniser probably a rapist but he was definitely a terrorist who wanted those passengers dead,negative
el habashi is a womanizer who is rotting in hell because he deliberately crashed the plane every country should ban egyptian air and egypt from doing anything,negative
sexual predator deathdive,negative
i like how there was one person at the news conference the coast guard spokesman and not jagoffs standing around in the background all fat and stupid waiting to get on camera like there is these days,negative
muslim always be muslim where it may be,negative
obvious really egyptian government they were the unprofessional ones of course he was a psychoharasser religious fanatical and an ego butthurt one because at his age he was not going to be a captain,negative
its call aggressive its cultural most asian side the way they talk,negative
my understanding is that if the captain had been blamed then the captains wife and kids would not have qualified for his pension add to that the egyptian government being unwilling to let a revered captains reputation embarrass them and this is what you get,negative
my spidey senses tell me he purposely downed that plane,negative
this was clearly intentional egyptians dont like that but evidence is evidence you like it or not,negative
lesson one never fly with muslim pilots this isnt the first time this sort of thing has happened,negative
what a pig,negative
true story sitting on an egypt plane the seat was rocking not bolted in cairo airport early hours of the morning waiting to take off a loud bang from one engine and a massive bright spark flew out horizontally across the runway at about mile an hour leaving sam l shake years ago the plane flew out to see for minutes and then banked and flew back the same way we just come heading over sini up to cairo egypt would be the last fly i ever go on,negative
pull up pull up,negative
forever in hell such a selfish fool,negative
intro,negative
knock off the nonsense there is no mystery the selfish narcissisticevil stubborn mentally deranged monster did a most unholy and sinful thing by tje standards of any religion he murdered all those innocent people on board while committing suicide end of this contrary nonsense case closed class dismissed,negative
its incidents like this why i dont fly in airplanes,negative
the jihad prayer threw me off,negative
why are these mayday actors so damn good,negative
muslims dont commit suicide wonder what those vests strapped with explosives are for,negative
one of the reasons why i dont believe that the plane develops mechanical problems leading to crash its that all of the existing crash that as happened i realised the cockpit were corresponding with aviation control but for this one theres not any so i found out that the piolot created suside,negative
islam yeaaaay,negative
once an investigation enters the realm of opinion then the cause of the accident is only conjecture,negative
there is no government in the entire world that will object with the mil dollar ntsb findings it can only be the egyptians reminds me of when the israeli air force destroyed of their air force on the ground by surprise that they still told the egyptian people we have destroyed the entire israeli air force such idiots,negative
omg thats horrible rip,negative
guess what god sees all,negative
seems like a pretty clear cut case of terrorism if you ask me while he may not have had a group he was affiliated with he sure as heck decided to perform the actions of those that practice jihad sick selfish man may he rot in hell for his actions and may those he selfishly took from this earth be free in the kingdom of heaven prayers and peace be with those affected by this completely avoidable tragedy,negative
religion is dumb,negative
you dont give automation total control over any moving vehicle there should be a disconnect where you can fly a plane manually,negative
he was an old narcissistic manwho wanted his power backhe should never have been left alonesuch an unnecessary tragedy,negative
pretty clear what happened here how none of the assigned crew were in the cockpit at the time descent was initiated is mind boggling,negative
they left the control in the hands of an arrogant suicidal psycho they paid with their lives just like the psycho of german wings,negative
elbatouty was a murderer plain and simple,negative
i guess flying to third world countries is a bad idea,negative
he did it on purpose periodt,negative
what a poskilling all of those innocent people,negative
murder,negative
smithsonian is evil,negative
amazing so nobody knows how to speak egyptian or arabic,negative
he was a terrorist pretty clear,negative
the allegation of the hotel sexual harassment happened way before not one day before the flight wtf difference does it make so it means nothing since it wasnt the day before the flight this creepy pilot had severe issues yet nothing was questioned or done before he downed that plane all of those reports of harassment should have grounded the guy not to mention all the other signs of him having serious issues good to know that saving face by lying and denying is more important than all of those lives lost sickening,negative
what happened to the narrator,negative
he is a mass murderer,negative
to all the people who are traveling may god bless you and a safety flight nothing bad will happen in jesus name no one will die in the name of god god is protecting every single one of you amen,negative
this a very interesting video movie im also like investigating what happened,negative
lol come on people that was murder suicide period,negative
your dad killed them he did it,negative
he killed everyone murderer,negative
listening to the denial of the egyptians and family is mindblowing egyptians dont commit suicide gtfo,negative
of course the mechanical failure scenarios simulations proved fruitless the was a robust aircraft with the latest of technology at the time the gimli glider was a that air canada pilots pearson and quintal glided and side slipped into an abandoned airfield in manitoba after running out of fuel out of toronto landing it on its nose without the nose gear in front of unsuspecting shocked racetrack patrons,negative
so he was sexually harassing women the night before he was meant to be back home with his sick daughter vile,negative
and so he killed innocent people wtf,negative
pilots arguing in the cockpit l am asking you,negative
this isnt the first time the egyptian govt has tried to cover up the truth,negative
unlike trump sick ass clinton did not jump to conclusion he did not say it was caused by dei,negative
no discussion about jihad,negative
what does heavy mean i never heard it explained in the dozens of airflight videos i watched,negative
the pilot on the right seat is on a suicide mission mentally ill a disturbed man with psychological struggles it seems like it based on the video pharaoh culture probably,negative
there is nothing wrong with saying tawaqqaltu alallah its a praying which people say when they handover everything to the most powerful almighty allah the lady who is calling it illogical i dont know what she could do in that situation they tried their best to save the plane when things got out of control they prayed to god what is illogical here,negative
i rely on god famous and sad last words,negative
the egyptians are such liarsthey only care about saving face not the truth,negative
anwar is a coward,negative
,negative
i think he did it on purpose bc he was so eager to fly it if i was a copilot and another pilot told me he wanted to take over with the other pilot i wouldve said you tryna kill us arent you like that literally says it all the capt wanted to go to the bathroom he was hesitant at first then said fck it shut off the engines and went for a nose dive,negative
never leave the allah akbar guy alone in the cockpit of a plane,negative

wow that was intense,negative
i guess irragamce is not just in america,negative
,negative
what makes it even worse than the relative who tried to cover up for him is him himself committing multiple murders in the name of god how despicable is that,negative
remember malaysia just saying,negative
maybe it was an impulsive suicide not preplanned that he was given the opportunity and took it richard bachman writes in the bridge across forever about his subliminal suicidal impulses while flying his own little planes that he would invite death by doing risky things being in control of an airplane would be a big temptation for anyone with selfdestructive impulses swimming around inside them although from what i read online it may have been more about revenge on the man who told him he couldnt fly usa routes any more that man was on the plane revenge seems more likely than suicide to be preplanned,negative
wicked sob to do this i wish the captain never got up,negative
this was a criminal act,negative
god i miss cairo,negative
muslims or egyptians dont commit suicide wtf,negative
did i miss it why were the engines shut off,negative
arabs are so pretentious they would never admit to a fault of their owna vile lot those people,negative
the plain was build by americans the corrupt american fbi was investigating the crash and the documentary was made by americans of course watching this would have convinced me the crash was the fault of the arab pilot maybe it is maybe it isnt well never know they should have put the investigation into the hands of russians then we would have known the truth,negative
the naivety of the egyptian authorities and el batoutis family is actually astounding,negative
i remember this accident it was on the news for a while lots of explanation but the truth is a mystery,negative
i dont get why do this if youre sucidal dont take inncoint people with youre this is so sad,negative
this is not a true story after pilot read the quran he killed himself and passengers co pilot fought against the pilot and lost the battle,negative
good post,negative
if its a muslim and arab that means something fishy,negative
the behind wing one was up end the oder wing was down,negative
hindi me bnao vidio,negative
ive seen myself on many flights that a flight attendant now has to come into the cockpit if one of the pilots goes out my question is in the very very unlikely situation that the remaining pilot tries to crash the plane what would the attendants do knock the pilot out with a bottle to their head that would make things worse the other pilot will try to get back to the cockpit but it might be impossible,negative
movie cover shows an a then you watch the trailer and see a goofy cgi well done,negative

not only do your movies suck they are also politically correct and childish really white people hijacking a plane why not be realistic and have muslims do it then maybe youd get some publicity for being controversial yeah sadly it would be thank liberals and maybe make some more money,negative

thetwilightlover megan you are the coolest kid i know thank you so much you made my day just to be clear i cowrote this with my dad i guess that would make him your great uncle paul,negative
needs more sharks,negative
guys you are awesome,negative
stop making films please do us all a favor,negative
what three mistakes did pilots make,negative
the human factor engineer is the ideal person for the career ladder,negative
terrybhull arsetralians,negative
what is with the first officers weird little whimpers in the dramatization was there like a recording of her actually making those sounds during the flight or is this just gratuitous sexism,negative
im sorry but why did they make the female actress moan and scream like that from all the episodes ive watched none of the male actors screamed like anything similar in similar or worse situations,negative
pulling back on the stick during a stall is equivalent to whiskey throttle on a dirt bike how can a pilot make it all the way to captain but still have amateur level skills,negative
the is job was a scam also these pilots were vulnerable earners i live in uk and earn and she was earning very sad what a shame this explains well why the crash occurred,negative
so i was recently in buffalo and stayed near the airport and noticed a park near my hotel they had a full memorial for all of the people onboard this plane,negative
it seems to me perhaps the stick shaker was trying to knock the stick downward and he knew the engines were extremely strongim not so sure the reason he was pulling up ive worked with guys driving forklifts under high stress start hitting the controls opposite what they are intending to do its like everything goes backwards,negative
this happened a few roads over from where i live now,negative
we know why the pilot was distracted,negative
its called a cockpit for a reason no women allowed,negative
this was not the worst crash of if af has anything to say about it,negative
the test pilot at the end looked like he was yearsold these regional pilots are desperate indeed,negative
bag clearly af is the dealiest plane crash in,negative
lol the solution is to make humans fatigueproof instead of just give the pilots decent working conditions xd pathetic,negative
its well known that those smaller airlines are cheaper becuase they are worse we shall be careful when choosing and know what we choose when we decide to fly that could have said to that poor mans daughter too right,negative
okay but wtf was that editing at for,negative
anyone here after the rehearsal,negative
i live in a flight path,negative
great investigations,negative
you can google maps this house and in its there in theres a vacant lot,negative
if its not metal fatigue its mental fatigue airlines should really try to avoid this word,negative
the map has the location of tampa bay wrong here the location pointed to is actually the caloosahatchee river in fort myerscape coral,negative
its sad that he takes the lords name in vain just before hes going to cross the veil and stand before him,negative
the crash also exposed the low wages of pilots at regional airlines in the united states a colgan air copilot earns about a year,negative
not deicing the wings,negative
the pilot makes less than a school janitor how is it even possible,negative
clarence center is in no way that dense of a suburb youre halfway into the country by the time you get out there i know its a minor point but still lol,negative
it boils down do airline greed they use puddle jumpers with pilots who are underpaid over worked i remember when this bill passed it ultimately forced airlines to spend the money and properly train pilots allow ample times for rest paying the st officer a yr when she has the lives of dozens depending on her being well rested is absolute greed on the part of the airlines,negative
people out here hailing the pilots because they were severly underpaid when the entire cause of this plane crashing were their incompetence useless first officer who doesnt engange in crm and a usless captain that broke basic rules of his aircraft,negative
the fact two people got out of that house alive is an absolute damn miracle,negative
providing pilots a room so they could have some rest could also help,negative
this is why i never fly these pilots are so unqualified to fly a plane,negative
i dont understand a word used by narrator kept saying cheduel cant find it in dictionary for instance work cheduel i assume its suppose to be schedule professional speaker cant speak american english,negative
a year figures out to a day for a day work week corporate greed is again the direct cause of another fatal plane crash,negative
im from buffalo ny and i was there when this plane went down in clearance center and i remember it being a horrible day in buffalo but like true baronian the families persevered came back and took this fight all the way to the senate so nobody else had to go through this which was totally preventable lets go buffalo,negative
damn that house didnt deserve that like really didnt ask for that,negative
it all comes down to money pay alot of money to such people everything will fall to place,negative
i think was worse,negative
min verified criminal liabilities changing the shape of the wing,negative
you see this time after time almost fear induced to pull back like in a car slamming your foot on the brakes,negative
that poor family in their house my word,negative
pilots are not paid enough and looked after they are the key to a safe landing for the people who pay to keep these planes in the air,negative
im sorry for your loss but your daughter was co pilot and talking throughout the flight where it was important to focus how is it the industry fault its bad piloting and co piloting whether tired or not their focus was the planenot banter those innocent passengers died bc of their mistakes i think personally its so your daughter isnt blamed they should have made sure they got their sleep in and used less energy chatting throughout the flight crazy sympathies for the families who lost their loved ones bc the pilots were too distracted to fly this plane properly shocking,negative
fatigue detectorthats too much regulation,negative
hope nobody ever gets a captain and first officer like these ever ever ever again,negative
hundreds of critical things in manual checklist wow how these crafts even get approved to fly,negative
fatigued pilots are even more hazardous than fatigued drivers on the road if you are too tired dont pilot a plane and dont drive,negative
a window who lost her husband in world trade center died on this flight she kept his voicemail he left before the towers fell until she diedi cant remember her name it was on the news about her deathrip to everyone on the flight,negative
i blame the airline what overworked pilots,negative

how is anyone surprised this happened females can barely drive cars and you thought it would be a good idea to let them fly sophisticated aircrafts,negative
why not have small bedrooms at the airport that the pilots can use to get some sleep in if they are tired like oncall rooms in hospitals for doctors and nurses,negative
these investigators are so clever,negative
watched too many of these never flying again,negative
everybody has times that they are overworked but have to perform you would think that flying and landing a airplane would be more than enough to cause a pilot to been overly alert and ready to perform and a simple stall situation should cause a reflex action to push forward and add power,negative
answer to firefighter question have you been near a bonfire yes i went to texas am the texas am aggie bonfire a longstanding tradition was permanently canceled after a deadly collapse in resulting in the deaths of students university officials initially explored options to revive the bonfire but ultimately decided against it the decision was made in june with president mark welsh iii stating that the bonfire should remain a part of the universitys history but not be revived,negative
how disgusting to pay them so little,negative
the q is not exactly a small plane its quite a large turbo prop,negative
the sterile cockpit procedure seemed to be overlooked and at the moment the red indicators were coming on to the instruments job changes were the topic at that moment stick shaker occurs which is stall warning i can remember this happening on an air france video where this caused pilots to pull back on the stick it seems a natural reaction but the opposite to what is technically required,negative
shout out onto the college kids for their work,negative
this happened down the road from me scary,negative
they knew how to operate it but not how to fly it,negative
how are they getting paid so little,negative
great work solving what went wrong human beings being human,negative
stall recovery is pretty much the first thing a pilot learns it should have been instinctive well integrated as muscle memory,negative
correct me if im wrong but it sounds to me like the problem is unwillingness to pay pilots a living wage the end irritated me they went to fight for stricter policies against the affect flying without adequate rest but not the cause what do you mean they cant afford a motel cant afford to take days off theyre exhausted for a reason if you want to prevent this they dont need stricter policies they need care for the human beings flying the plane,negative

my boss called me that night our admin her husband and son were all killed we were a close knit group and knew everyone so it was so sad and devastating when we had to make the announcement that next day at work people were in tears it was absolutely infuriating when we finally got the reports showing how all these deaths were so needless and it all coming down to profits ahead of lives,negative
the importance of looking after your employees airlines should give pilots money off vouchers at hotels or pay them more so they can afford to be wellrested,negative

imagine having a nice dinner with your family and a plane crashes directly into your house,negative
i mean its just embarrassing that a professional pilot doesnt have a basic understanding of how to react to a stall bizarre,negative
an fo only making k a year even for regional is insane i made more than that washing dishes,negative
i absolutely think planes are over complicated today pilots think the plane can fly themselves that they are only needed to land and take off so when an over complicated computer driven machine starts throwing all its toys in the air the cockpit crew are stumped and make things far worse hence this crash and many others like it come on what sort of pilot pulls the fight control column towards themselves to speed a plane up when they should be pushing it forward to speed it up,negative

pilots should not be making to a year starting salaries am should be and more pilots transport souls this country is backwards they pay entertainers millions meanwhile people with important jobs make a year rediculous yes i didnt stutter entertainment is not that important,negative
i remember watching this a while back and it stuck with me this reenactment is honestly terrifying,negative
they needed studies into over tired pilots the whole system is a joke,negative
why would anyone want to be a pilot for such ridiculous pay,negative

air france are you sure about that,negative
i think he made the mistake of trying to go higher to allow him more air speed with a longer decent,negative
i really cant take the heartache of the family that lose a child or family member but i really hate animal suffering im too empathetic or pathetic its a burden,negative
these airlines should do more to support their pilots they couldnt provide cots for their pilots,negative
below is criminal,negative
unfortunate that people will protest to pay teachers more more more they make a starting salary more than this capt while our kids learn nothing but no one speaks up about the pay for those who have to have an abundance of knowledge applicable under high stress to fly people thru the skies seems the copilot was under qualified and didnt take the job seriously either things you dont want to skimp on public safety airplane pilots and toilet paper,negative
i thought the airlines had contract hotels to allow their pilots access to rooms to sleep rest before departing on their next flights i guess i was wrong in this case how sad that this had to happen,negative
i remember this because i was in the airline industry as a regional flight attendant since i was the only fa for a seater aircraft we as a regional crew would have to face the constant jabs at us for our aircraft mine were embraer jets but i had to fly prop planes earlier and the evil remarks that the pilots that i flew with were either too young to fly or that they were women even after this incident we had to hear from passengers saying to us if the pilots had enough rest or coffee to fly on that day i told one passenger you dont have to fly with us today if you choose to think that way so much damn disrespect not just for us but for these poor souls who lost their lives so glad i retired from the industry,negative
it was later determined that the stick shaker trigger had been set improperly so when the stick shaker engaged the aircraft was not actually in or near a stall condition however when the captain reacted inappropriately to the stick shaker by pulling the nose up the aircraft entered an actual stall and the stick pusher activated as designed it pushed the nose down to recover from the stall but the captain again reacted improperly and overrode the pusher by pulling back again on the control column causing the plane to lose even more airspeed and control,negative

a brand new boeing crashed in amsterdam netherlands how and why the most sophisticated aircraft in the world has caused a disaster,negative
planes are becoming too reliant on computers when you take the human aspect out of the question and rely mostly on computers then the connection between man and machine breaks down and with out that personal connection they miss when something is wrong this is the reason why people name their machines whatever they may be a personal connection and feelings develop allowing people to notice when something is different or not right and faulty,negative
but but we have workers taking their dump in the fuel tanks we are inclusive,negative
i think mayday explained this very well its a bit faster than usual but they covered a lot very very well done,negative
boeing has a different view make as much money money is the key we need more money who cares if a plane falls out of the sky we need more money,negative
sounds like a failure mode looking for a victim crew after tries it found one,negative
what is wrong with the blond woman,negative
whoa surprising camera angle there i hope episode directors use more of these,negative

i really like the aci and watched each and every episode since many many years but now a days one thing bothers me that the show and the ntsb favours boeng and hides the lapses of boeng and reports from ntsb primarily blames pilots boeng is a criminal company and should be sued for their carelessness from years,negative
my style of planning flight plan take off cruise descent and approach is messy i also love critical phases excite im also talking about flight sims lol energy management is what i love to challenge myself with trying to practice high energy states,negative

pin please,negative
because the dont know how to fly practice is what we need,negative
if a pilot had been on their own that wouldnt have happened to many cooks ya de ya de ya,negative
is it only me or did the pilot say hamesterdam,negative
yes too complex,negative
maybe they should give loud voice warnings instead of flashing lights and beeping something along the lines of emergency the error is blah blah blah fix the problem or die no pilot will willingly ignore the threat of death unless they are suicidal,negative
boeing is a pos company that doesn value human life,negative
why was the cabin so small,negative
all of these big money carriers are alike profits over safety i hope one day theyre all sued into oblivion get some competent pilots too,negative
i think this is the only episode which goes straight to the investigation rather than the flight from a passengercrew perspective,negative
i thank there wouldnt be any harm in not fully rely on the pre flight mechanics they r not beyond errors to prevent or a precaution against the loss of human life get specially trained dogs to check the aircrafts and rely on their judgement dogs make no mistakes,negative
i am not happy about these summaries prior to actual start of the episode l ve abandoned more than episode shame they r all excellent,negative
sonetimes i think the more a plane is designed to all but fly itself including landing the more the pilots depend on auto pilot instead of flying the plane,negative
what is the point of implementing automation if the automation doesnt work if you cant count on the machine doing its job dont use it you might as well do it yourself,negative
boeing is killer company,negative
if working properly even though his statement is controversial the crew was incompetent let us not forget that these are not perfect machines free from errors,negative
technology used to serve mankind now mankind is serving technology,negative
for no good reason i always get a kick out of being able to see landing gear in flight because they dont have gear doors at least it makes it easy to tell from an airbus as it flies over,negative
so the captain was depending on a computer system that he didnt fully understand,negative
this is boeing,negative
no my little one is also,negative
still look like human error,negative
boeing received a whopping,negative
how about the boeing vps nonchalance,negative
did anyone notice the american chap talking looked like elmo the real murderer of the bankers wife and her lover in the film shawshank redemption,negative
two things were wrong both boil down to human error putting up with faulty equipment was in my opinion the gravest error and secondly relying on the computers of the plane like the man said at the end the pilot is meant to fly the plane,negative
what the heckthey had to go through a long check list that caused them not to notice they were already in stalling modeand too late before they knew something not right,negative
guys stop commenting because i enter these type of videos and i see a comment like oh if they would have fixed that btch it s like you tell me from the start of the movie that the end will be sad or happy i want to see that myself also you can t change nothing by commenting on youtube,negative
the way that the set up the training is dangerous allowing distractions for the one trained pilot at the wheel the captain should not be training but flying and the other officer behind them should be doing the training of the trainee that way both jobs of the captain and the first office is being done completely,negative
never ever fly in a boeing jet especially the ones constructed in carolina i avoid all of them regardless airbus or bust is my motto,negative
schiphol aiport is not in amsterdam but in haarlemmermeer about km drom amsterdam just saying,negative
the only thing i have clear from many of these accidents is dont fly in boeing planes that company seems unfortunately to care more about profit and popularity than actual passenger safety imagine having over warnings about a faulty instrument and doing absolutely nothing about it until it brings a plane down,negative
every time that i open accidentally the same episode i immediately understand it by the ultra annoying at the seriously wtf was that,negative
so sad it hit the field but it should have been able to land in that field practically no matter what,negative
if they managed to land they will land on belly,negative
i think they are at least for some people without enough training,negative
fine and good but a pilot is avionics personal not engineering that is able to connect the dots of malfunctioning or strangely behaving stuff and that is difficult even in normal situation without ground closing in having lots of data is nice but you need to structure it having automation is in control is fine most of the time but the moment you enter a circumstance or have bugs you wont recover because the plane says nuh nuh nuh in my opinion data presesentation is key also a direct alert of having different data from the same type of sensor or actuator and the plane should request hey man what are we going to do about this aka in this case which data should i use because i cant help it its working together with the plane doing its job and the pilot being the backup in case things get funny,negative
i loved watching this show on quest channel im glad i can watch it here,negative
i have flown with turkish airlines once hand on heart i can say it was the worst flight experience in my life mechanical failures twice on one booking once at london and the very next flight at istanbul delayed by hours most of which we had to lie down in istanbul airport on hard ground forget customer service turkish people dont have basic empathy eu compensation never paid one application takes months to process and at the time of payment they just dont pay then you run out of time start the process all over again wait for another months then they send a payment form you fill and send they dont pay it has been months not a penny paid i lost working days have to arrange other flights and have to take the loss anyway in a nutshell dont fly turkish,negative
boeing after receiving reports of their faulty radio altimeters finally decided to shrug off and do absolutely nothing incredibly criminal,negative
check,negative
just listen to that boeing ceo and youll understand why no one should ever fly on any boeing planes,negative
no your not,negative
thank you for uploading the episodes you make a great bunch of us so happy,negative
i remember seeing this on the local news i was about years old and can still remember being surprised about the plane still being so intact after the crash,negative
surprise surprise more screwups by boeing but at least the shareholders got rich with all the stock buybacks i dont want to fly boeing airplanes only airbus,negative
i hope im not the only one addicted to this channel,negative
ha ha i thought the same i thought it was,negative
the americans always lie about the dangerous boeing,negative
boeing make flying coffins,negative
do not understand how three pilots including a safety observer failed to notice the airspeed,negative
airbus airshow pilot im going around a computer no youre not im landing whoops messy,negative
the question should be that why did the fuel tanks did not explode did it help that the landing gear was down,negative
keep the planes simple enough let the latest technology provide reliable information for the pilots pilots need to relearn good oldfashioned flying,negative
runways should have lights,negative
i know my life is pathetic when i spend much of it watching people die in airplane crashes,negative
boeing a self declared superiority badge right from day over hyped,negative
can you open the downlownd pleas,negative
fan of your voice over,negative
this was not a microburst it was a turkish burst,negative
and yesterday another crashed near the runway boeing corrected the radio altimeter fault right,negative
the main issue was the plane design there has to be a setting in autowhatever when there is one parameter wrong the pilot should be able to set the auto in a correct way autothrottle or autopilot is good if the inputs are correct if some input goes wrong there has to be a system settings to control auto systems,negative
flew on a about months ago there smooth until you hit turbulence obviously the landing was rough but im glad it was a safe landing anyway we were in a hold for over an hour due to the weather im glad our pilots waited,negative
as a first officer candidate if i become a pilot one day id never ever want to use any airplane that boeing has made the ceo is driving me crazy yes the pilots should have been more careful on the indicators but that is a true ux and engineering error as a plane manufacturer you have to test your airplanes again and again by its technical abilities and the cockpit in the matter of user experience this is something unacceptable if i would be at the place of turkish airlines id never order a boeing airplane again,negative
automation error cannot be ignored in this accident,negative
what was useless third pilot doing his job was to monitor safety of the flight,negative
so boeing killed them,negative
i work in it if we have the same incident faulty altimeter occurring over and over again we reclassify it as a problem at this time were looking for a permanent solution so the incident doesnt happen again,negative
i thought the rd pilot was there to watch the instruments due to the captain doing the training,negative
seems to me that the pilot had too much on his plate dealing with a faulty altimeter and training and being brought in too high to catch the signal from above instead of from below,negative
anyone knows the episode of that crew on minute,negative
it amazes me to find out that theres a warning sound for a faulty altimeter but no warning alarms when the speed decreased so low that it reached stall levels,negative
it seems to me that in many cases automation has given pilots a false sense of security when they ought to be carefully monitoring the various screen in much the same way as happens on a submarine had any one of them looked at their airspeed indicator this accident would never have happened equally yet again we see boeing not dealing with faulty equipment until its too late,negative
which sshole keeps ignoring the landing config warning that pilot shouldnt even drive an bicycle let alone a car,negative
i only trust dutch trained pilots,negative
this is why we should never say we have enough redundancy the auto pilots should be hooked up to every system at all times and decide together what to do,negative
when the plane hit the ground you hear kebab,negative
boeing view is to provide information to the pilots very believable max speaks for itself,negative
the irony of seeing this and the max issues is that it seems boeing has been doing this whole nahh mate well take it off a single sensor thing for much longer than youd think if they used both radar altimeters they couldve seen there was a disagree which then should immediately disable autothrottle flip a master caution and force the pilots to handfly but no guess that was too logical,negative
since the was upgraded to ng all that there are are flaws after flaws failure after failure these airplanes design is flawed stop it please they have crept into the max system nine dead are too many three hundred plus are unacceptable,negative
why cant they install a camera system on planes for pilots to see the ground or outside the plane,negative
communicate navigate then aviatorsimples,negative
only a complete melon would believe that the meant the year and not the flight number only people brainless clueless and mentally slow could possibly think something so stpid,negative
turkish airline not for me,negative
there is two key features of all flying airspeed and altitude why cannot the manufakturers haw displays like cars to high lite just this two most important parameters,negative
this accident should never happens in an airbus with the alfa protection mode boeing should install the same feature simple as that the alfa protection mode works independently of both autopilots and would have understood the low airspeed and correct it even the new chines comac has it why not boeing simply another boeing accident where the system failed or was simply missing boeing has a lot to work on if not we will have a new duopoly in the skies comac and airbus,negative
well a verbal warning of airspeed would seem even more important than pull up the stick shaker was useless at this point the planes computer auri throttle and defective altimeter intentionally stalled the plane on its own and crashed yes checking air speed is mandatory however if there was a verbal automated or verbal airspeed warning before the stick shaker this and other crashes of smart places could be prevented,negative
so why did the flight crew die,negative
wow no pilot survived the cockpit was in near perfect condition post wreckhaving seen enough of these shows maybe we need to start focusing on what pilots are doomed to die on of all accidents yet no special restraints air bags nothing has been added to the cockpit its a deathtrap so why did all three die,negative
i really dont think perusing the flight data recorder will tell you if it was raining,negative
yup the flight number isnt the year i was confused by the lcd screens as well ah well ill watch and see,negative
lol how is it possible for the plane manufacturer not to foresee that failure of a component the autopilot takes information from could in fact become a safety issue,negative
increased amount of automation is making airplanes so complex and hand flying is becoming a lost art,negative
i think it is worrying that a plane suddenly can fall to the ground like a rock because of a pilot error,negative
if its boeing i aint going,negative
is it that hard to design two big jumbo ledlcd displays with altitude and speed in the cockpit,negative
the cockpit workload was too high largely due to the schipol landing for the pilots to even recognise the subtle warning that the plane was giving them theres elements of mode confusion too with automated flight systems plenty of landings have turned to poo because of similar events i have to place some blame with being for not masking out obvious radio altimeter erroneous readings too it should reject negative values entirely better still would be to compare the two radio altimeter values for inconsistency,negative
the trouble is that piolets are relying om technoligy more and more reather then flying the plane,negative
pretty boring too much detail so glad i as not on it poor victims,negative
another airline i would never fly shocking safety record,negative
excellent information and narration,negative
boeing planes are death traps always when there is a techical issue it is a boeing why are they not banned,negative
how come the nose didnt break like it did irl see the nose is broken in the real footage,negative
so everything started around boeing become sloppy company now doors are flying autopilots crashing planes,negative
from my viewpoint it was the pilots error who kept on ignoring the caution signal by pushing constantly the button to postpone it that caused the crash the planes insufficient maintenance was very crucial too,negative
hog wash investigators have determined that turkish airlines flight crashed mainly because the pilots didnt recognize the consequences of the warnings no the main cause was a design flaw by boeing that the pilots were not trained to lookout for the malicious domino effects of the faulty reading then came into play under circumstances which masked the symptoms produced by those effects early in the video i pondered on why there was no override switch for ground proximity radar feed to the autopilot system aps having a mute button to silence an audio alarm is nice but if a crew determines that a critical flight reading and it is why they often have duplicates is faulty not only should they be able to silence the audible warning but to as well cut its data feed to the aps how can that not be obvious to boeing or any large commercial plane maker once determined to be in error the override would be enacted manually by the pilot and the aps computer could then use the feed from the other radar sensor or at the very least not be subject to faulty data causing the plane to behave catastrophically while it might could be said that the ultimate cause was due to the pilots lack of attentiveness it wasnt in fact the main cause the main cause was a boeing design flaw without a doubt if you design a machine to perform based upon inputs that can be faulty without providing an override opportunity for the crew then it is the designer who is at fault,negative
here it seems that both human error they should have monitored the speed and altitude of the plane and their reliance on the newly changed altimeter and its computer unfortunately caused the plane to crash maybe shouldnt the altimeter and its computer which were reported to have changed days ago and have faults reported on these planes be recalled i have seen this plane a few times at istanbul atatrk airport,negative
never finding the fault with the radio altimeter the reading of give a very exact clue that would probably be the distance if the receiver were to pick up the transmitter without bouncing off the ground it indicates they either have cross talk between the two or they need to install a delay in the receiver before monitoring the receiver signal for a bounce take any plane you have on hand and put a scope across the receiver on the ground and see what comes off the receiver antenna i dont have a degree and couldnt get a job with them but the failure is pretty clear also the warning should be flashing red and some sort of tone should sound indicating they need to check the instruments,negative
,negative
its precise listen to what this person says,negative
instead of having a low airspeed color changing display with no voice warningthey should have an ai voice like the too low terrain voice telling them to check air speedair speed air speed air speed,negative
i truly hope john nance was joking being sarcastic when he mentioned god taking a plane off the skygod does not exist,negative
this was and obviously boeing has kept of messing up their with adding more and more automation for the pilots to guess when something goes wrongfly the damn plane,negative
if the pilots radio altimeter fails shouldnt they switch to the copilots as they would with a faulty airspeed indicator they knew it was faulty why didnt they do that,negative
another boeing,negative
state of the art aircraft flown by a state of the art anthropoid,negative
another crash caused by automation flying the plane instead of the pilots,negative

the first plane to crash near the airport in ten years wow that is really something to boast about what an accomplishment,negative
reports of faulty radio altimeters all they care is money and not safety,negative
lol boeing prefers to give its pilots information so they can make the decisions also boeing lets make the max series and not tell anyone of a system that doesnt require pilot input,negative
the only thing boeing is working on is in profits not in safety and quality even their ceo said that the max accidents were becouse their pilots werent american for god sake what pile of trash i choose airbus over boeing anytime,negative
windshear,negative
the primary cause of the crash was a malfunctioning radio altimeter the radio altimeter is a critical component that measures the aircrafts altitude above the ground by bouncing a radio signal off of the ground and recording the response time providing data to various automated systems including the autothrottle,negative
could you please stop calling boeing planes state of the art or the queen of the skies it has been clearly demonstrated otherwise,negative
even there was no clue how this aircraft came downthe findings are only theoretical findings,negative
wow so sad this happened,negative

a okay,negative
watch this already but gotta watch it again,negative
i know this was a long time ago but its crazy to think that testing standards would only be a full speed when you consider than a plane will be changing speeds during descents hail doesnt only happen during cruising times,negative
and this is why we should not have a fullyautomated cockpit,negative
gulf of america not gulf of mexico,negative
that pilot sure led an eventful life,negative
one of the beauties of aviation and aviation safety is that whenever a problem is found everybody works to find a solution immediately yes m yes like a dc whose cargo door blee off twice killing passengers because mcdonald douglas did not f bother to fix the problem even though the national transportation safety board hot pointed out the problem it happened a third time when a boeing from new zealand to honolulu part of the plane blew off killing night passengers who fell to the ocean and the national transportation safety board did everything possible to cover it up until the family of one of the deceased the campbells found out and exposed what had really happened,negative
fyi a experienced pilot would not have tried to land in such bad weather they would have powered through to clear the weather then land on a runway its all good they got they plane down but how much fuel did they have and what kind of adc awos or atc weather alerts did they get before deciding to continue decent into a storm,negative
most professional crew ever on mayday,negative
you cant park there mate d d,negative
i would love to meet this team what dam good pilots,negative

fantastic professionalism,negative

they should not have decided to go on to there st destination but landed at the air force base obviously there is a problem anyone with sense would land at the nearest airport asap what a bunch of morons to go on further than they needed to with a sick plane,negative
there is monocular training for piolets,negative
i like it when this show shows people who were on the plane bc then i know that at least some of them survived,negative
yes dhaka i mean bangladeshi captains are very professional,negative
as always some dumb lady crying poor me while adding nothing of value to the conversation why just stains an otherwise great piece for no reason other than some dumb idiot,negative
please dont criticize me but can someone tell me whats the meaning of mayday,negative
,negative
love this pilot,negative
all credit to the captain he found a solution where none seemed to exist whatta story to tell,negative
i must say its a fairly ballsy move to fly out a plane that just did what was effectively a crash landing as the favoured method of removing it intact,negative
sully pearson dardano landing planes outside of airport runways successfully and saving everyone on board,negative
just wanna say we should always have jesus i all our vessel at all cost in advance css only with him the impossible are possible thank god for calvary hes grate amongst greatness he always is and always will be thank you jesusgrwte job to all of the pilot god was on your side these are testimony for a lifetime,negative
its called the gulf of america,negative
this is the first time ive seen a damaged plane fly again just to inspect its damaged parts better the pilot really managed to keep it in such a good condition,negative
bravo to the team i see more than a gifted pilot,negative
wow what a professional,negative
if this guy was american we would have never heard the end of it captain danardo and captain pearson from gimli glider the original sullys,negative
i love that plane shes so big and crazy land on a field take off from a field experienced captain test pilots also,negative
o ambiente favoreceu a todos e a aeronave hari om,negative
to fly a huge aircraft with just eye is unbelievable and landing safely as well is truly amazing i salute captain deka and teka airlines,negative
now this is a real captain this absolute legend landed a crippled plane on a strip of land with no engines no visuals and nothing but raw unfiltered piloting genius man turned a death trap into a soft landing with sheer skill thats not flying thats sorcery give him the highest award a statue a netflix doc and a hollywood blockbuster this isnt just aviation its a miracle wrapped in steel meanwhile they hyped up sullenberger like he was moses parting the red sea bro landed a plane in a river next to the airport in daylight after a bird strike and they handed him medals like he dodged missiles respect but come on this guy out here doing the aviation equivalent of brain surgery blindfolded in a thunderstorm and no ones talking about it time to fix that put some respect on this mans name,negative
a very good pilot also we thank god for his protection via giving them wisdom and some angel help hallelujah,negative
if i was ever to request a pilot i would want this captain wow he is amazing,negative
pilots dont announce mayday mayday just because theyre in a storm,negative
past aviation accidents have continued to ensure that flying is more and more safe unfortunately plane crashes and passenger deaths were and are the ultimate scarifice that was made to make flying safer because design changes are made to correct the issues that caused plane crashes unfortunately it is not always design flaws that cause plane crashes you can have pilot error too,negative

truly outstanding airmanship,negative
excuse me its gulf of america,negative
hallelujah,negative
blessed by the divine,negative
if ive learned something from all these documentaries is that pilots that could be described as unusual are the kind you want when the plane is in trouble bush pilots former army pilots pilots with glider experience that sort of thing those pilots have nerves of steel and impressive improvisation skills,negative
wow i could hug you all you are most so clever and fabulous god was with you because he loves you so much xx love from sue from the uk you are all worth your weight in pure god god bless you all herosxx,negative

i dont get it why the radio stopped working it is the one that needs to be working all the time dont they have batteries in planes btw doesnt the apu also deliver power,negative
so you take episodes from the tv serie air crash investigation from discovery and use them as your own that is just dirty and scammy,negative

they should have had joe pesci play the role of the captain as he looks like him,negative
sully eat your heart out,negative
as a salvadoran i miss taca so much one of my favorite airlines when i was a kid traveling back to my country i hate it so much that avianca bought them and now its a shadow of what it once was,negative
incredible landing in aviation history,negative
with one eye he did it remember the name the legend captain carlos dardano,negative
the plane doesnt have ram air turbine,negative
unbelievable that captain and his crew,negative
captain dardano and his colleagues you are the true heroes of aviation absolutely legendary incredible landing,negative
amazing emergency landing at the right moment and right place to land,negative
thank god,negative
what a badass captain,negative
god is so faithful,negative
,negative
are the people being interviewed actor as well,negative
when are our scientists going to develop something like automatic air bags or like a robotic drone which can provide support in times like this because of late is not even safe travelling by an aircraft,negative
good night pastor russell and church family,negative

i have to be honest and a little biased captain sully was the best landing ever and im a ny native so this guy is probably rd best landing,negative
gulf of america,negative
imagine being the guy who first suggested why dont we just takeoff from the levee,negative
god bless pilots hands and stchristopher tos safe emergency landing,negative
woau an amazing captain and crew,negative

this episode had me on the edge of my seat superlative stuff,negative

well lets not look at it year to year lets look at the past years in year or year increments that will tell you alot more is aviation overall getting safer over time as it had been for a long time or has that changed for some reason i actually wonder what if any impact the pandemic has had is having or will have in the future on aviation safety were corners cut on maintenance during the pandemic if so has it gone back to pre pandemic standard or not and are there events set in motion by the pandemic that will have disasterous consequences down the road because every other industry was hurt by the pandemic with many industries becoming shells of their former selves with something like airline maintenance it can take years for the consequences to play out,negative

a deployable emergency evacuation mechanism must be patented now its too too unacceptable to let people burn or dismember from impactfire,negative
pilot attempted to land but was unstable and went around then a nd attempt then a rd no this was actually the th attempt counting the first that failed in fog and why cant a modern plane land in fog if they land in fog they dont get hit by a missel a new cirrus private jet is equipped with auto land if pilot dies any schmuck can depress the auto land button plane finds nearest airport and lands itself a mongoloid missing link monkey boy can land a cirrus jet but qualified experienced pilots cant land a new embraer e in the fog wtf,negative
not sure why the dutch nationals are given more importance than the others,negative
was an incredibly sobering year for aviation after such a safe its heartbreaking to see how quickly that progress can be undone especially when some of these tragedies may have been preventable weve also been following these incidents closely and breaking down what went wrong every case tells a deeper story of human decisions mechanical failures or systemwide oversights thanks for presenting them with respect and clarity these stories need to be told not just remembered,negative
ii,negative
um we still dont know what happened to mh so u made that one up,negative
poot innocent people,negative
if is the most since what about ppl already dead from india air,negative
thanks for posting so sad rip sweet people blessings to all,negative

thanks for saying the survivors were sitting rear sit behind i will make sure when am the flights i sit on those sit behind,negative
maybe the pilots of jeju airlines could have landed in the sea maybe more lives could have been saved in water during a crash landing,negative
beautiful beautiful narration,negative
bro brush your teeth,negative
ignore the alert really life is matter you dont make mistake especially stupid mistake ok peoples,negative
yep is the deadliest year of aviation tbh,negative
i dont think flying is safe anymore nowadays cuz theres too many planes crashes ever since last year and this year,negative
rip bro,negative
now the second passenger airline deliberately shot down by russian missile putin is a murderous monster like hitler may the lord gods judgement come upon him and his family,negative
problem is we allready got deaths within months of,negative
i hope the world knows aircraft break just like cars how many cars u own ever up an quit to boot the guys that own the air lines throw the least amount of money legally if any possible the ones u see go there just tired of sinking money into them then what do you know they just got cut a check for a million dollar plane dog eat dog world my friends,negative
russia is not at war in most places and yet still have active missiles that shoot on sight,negative
look at car crash deaths and tell me how planes arent safe,negative
another one to add and i pray thats it no more pleaseeeeee,negative
air india is the worst airplane crash,negative
i hope i dont get a panic attack when i enter a plane next time i have been watching way too much plane crash videos lately,negative

jeju still doesnt make sense they couldve just continued their approach and landed without initiating a go around even coming in with no flaps or gear down they seemed to maintain fairly controlled flight why call a go around we need answers,negative
to be continued in,negative
this guy did this video on my birthday,negative
any els agree with what imm gonna say if u do like or commont dw if u dont want to this makes me more scared of planes like im already scared of them,negative

way too many crashes wtf,negative
should have waited till days ago and you could have nearly doubled the total death count,negative
i went to sao paulo days after th crash,negative

flew to italy last year and the day we came back was pure hell with everything that happened days later the brazilian plane crashed due weather which was also the thing that triggered the situation that left us traumatized i got travel vouchers for the experience but they expire this year so i booked us a flight hoping it goes better there was plane crashes that happened recently and im so anxious now,negative
someone needs to restrict me from youtube because this is what i watch before going on a flight,negative
womp womp,negative
why dont they have a fire extinguishing system on airstrips and racetracks hidden in the ground every meters that will automatically go out in the event of an accident,negative
was this not ment to be set up,negative
this why i will not get on an airplane,negative
im sitting here on my couch watching this while my wife is literally in the air aboard southwest airlines on here way home to phoenix from chicago also sitting here trying to remember where she said she keeps our life insurance paperwork just in case,negative
jal had deaths,negative
thank you jesus,negative
not a fan of stating that people lost their lives when they were obviously killedmurdered by military like saying somebody lost their life to multiple gunshots no the person was murdered,negative
i have high respect for pilots that take their job serious its sad sad how some disasters are unable to prevent at that moment a single small mistake can result in big loss after all the aviation rules are written with blood,negative
st one is so brutal,negative
how the hell do you not configure the plain for landing when you are landing,negative
thise are not real itwas all made by himself,negative
naravno da letenje postaje sve manje sigurno avio kompanije ne odrzavaju avione jer stedepiloti nemaju kvalitetnu obuku vec postaju instant neiskusni kapetani sto znaci da kompanije ubrzavaju obuku neiskusnih pilota sto dovodi do katastrofa kontrole letenja prave uznemirujuce propustena sve to izrabljivanje posada koje iovako neiskusne postaju preumorne i nesposobne da pravovremeno reaguju avijacija postaje teska industrija gde trka za profitom ubrzava ceo sistem koji pod pritiskom pravi tragicne greske i propuste,negative

bruh im going on a plane on friday and ive been doing this since i was months old and i dont feel safe,negative
intro people lost their lives in people lost their lives in one accident,negative
bro just one crash in this video,negative
i know theres less aircraft crashes than in regular motor vehicle accidents but i still feel safer just knowing i can turn a car faster than a aircraft or ship for that matter,negative
flying was never safe a fact of life,negative
is flying still safe not with all them diversity hires,negative
ill drive to tijuana mexico from now on,negative
idiots,negative
,negative
nevertheless the accidents flying is still safe rest in peace all of the victims who died my deepest condolences to all of their loved ones,negative
every time you step into an elevator there is a risk of crash due to malfunction so are you taking the stair from tomorrow onwards,negative
say prayers,negative
please add bangla language auto translate,negative
wtf were the russians thinking,negative
noooo santa couldve been on there,negative
ive never flown and never will,negative
russia pmo the stupidity in targeting innocent civilians on air or on ground needs to stop its so cruel,negative
well this was not a good thing to watch while i wait for my flight,negative
a crash into the pacific ocean today killing all occupants of the plane it has been confirmed that one of the passengers was andre of the fame rap group outkast is dead,negative
rip all who were on board,negative
honestly that the atrs icing problem still hasnt been fixed since is effing scary i have no problems with flying in itself and will still do it but for sure will never board an atr like heck no,negative
i pray for them,negative
russia sucks,negative
the size comparison in the thumbnail is ridiculous the plane window being the size of a human,negative
because the technology is starting to fail and later in the coming years this technology will no longer work,negative
eh ive never been in a plane or a boat ill keep on living life on the ground the way god intended,negative
blurring an explosion this is way overboard with the blurring frenzy on youtube how about blurring the whole video save time and we viewers just listen to the videos,negative
i am so scared now oh gosh,negative
dage,negative
still safe flying was never safe,negative
the first one cargo earthquake survival supply also japan airlinesana collided,negative
wow a devoured the q,negative
the fact that the pilot survied the crash in this nepal saurya airlines is crazy aff and as i know there was a child with his parents the child had recently gone far away from home and his parents decided to suprise him by taking hours long trip each to go and return to take hm from where he was and immediatly they headed towards this airport for pokhara for suprise visit to their relatives who knew it would have been the last long day of all of those peoples life this country nepal has the deadliest airlines including the worlds most dangerous airport wheere the runway is way shorter and exactly after the runway finishes there is a big gap with high feets exactly measured of meters which is feets deep where the point of takeoff successfully are very less and out of full half of thea accidents are caused in this airport and this saurya airlines was pretty sure heading towards lukla airport,negative
it doesnt sit right with me that those highly educated people got paid more attention that the other victims why didnt mothers teachers the eldelry get mentioned are their desths less of a tragedy,negative
what the hell is up with russiaa jackass in power perhaps yesdamn,negative
this is why i have aerophobia its sad i love planes butto risky rip people,negative
yeah aint looking to hot either,negative
the moment you ignore alarms because they give a false alarm so many times you know it will go wrong one day this was a crash waiting to happen,negative
im from uruguay and the mention of the andes disaster really touched me,negative
why do you blur out the crashes this world is so soft its sickening,negative
azerbaijan,negative
can you do about the crashes in,negative
that one airplane on the street and sees another plane and the plane was like oops,negative
guess not all can be as lucky as tom hanks,negative
is way worst guys and due to deportation becareful dont leave to your countries or other countries with out checking if you can come back and also stay away from countries like middle east or some south east asian countries so many people r jusr leaving and not realizing the type danger we are in also north korea dont go all of sudden this countries are offering tours and visits especially if you have social media account dont lock it and becareful what u speak about,negative
how is it allowed countries can shoot down airplanes,negative
as horrible as it is that people lose their lives in these accidents compared to the numbers that perish or get severly injured in traffic on the ground it is still less the difference imho is that we feel safer when we are in control driving ourselves than sitting in an airplane completely dependant on someone elses skills however i trust the pilots way more than the average fellow driver on the road including myself,negative
too much increasing traffic will bring to a higher accident rate this is only mathematics,negative
always pay abit more and fly with a decent airline your life will thank u later,negative
whats this inbetween the video turn off,negative
we can do something face fore flight crashing we can install some high capacity parachute system or baloon system in the flight roof and cover to full length in flight and it want to be make a auto system and manual system any truble or ane emergency situation if you think you cant handling your flight that time you can activate this parachute system or baloon system auto or manual sometimes we can save toboth of life for our peoples and wr can save property dificult for making but i thin it will successful for some presentage for save life and property,negative
i know someone that wasnt on any of those flights,negative
all dei hires come on people,negative
since all companies start hiring based on feelings imma press x to doubt,negative
cars accidents are even more please research,negative
nope not safe at all taking a chance every time u fly,negative
why the shit are the russians shooting fown passenger planes,negative
rip,negative
alot of people got promotion at that company after,negative
why is his nose shaped like that,negative
ive watched this posting x and continue to be so very impressed that crash causing bogus parts could make such life and death results in repairs thank you for bringing such details to viewers im yrs havent flown for years and as deadly accidents increase boeing currently i dont believe i will ever fly again integrity is key to aviation safety and professional integrity is not what it once may have been,negative
the company in question is kf aerospace one of canadas premier aircraft companies they have contracts and recognized design approval with the department of national defence if counterfeit parts made it into their stock they absolutely could make it onto air force one kf still fly convairs today as well as training canadian forces pilots and delivering mail to remote communities i was lucky enough to see one of their convair s flying over my neighbourhood in,negative
question the luggage within these big or small planes are they loaded lose in the storage area or are it strapped in or in located in lockers the reason why i ask because if a plane goes to much to left or right or upside down will play a devastating effect in weight distribution,negative
ive always thought the guy on the left in the thumbnail looked like peter jennings,negative
i think bogus parts and other stuff really vibrated in extraordinary force because of f it flew much closer to the plane and caused the crash but obviously military will always try to save their own fighter pilot they always do i feel sorry for the victims i think the plane was flying and continued to fly with bogus parts and with vibrations but f created powerful aerodynamic forces that caused these bogus parts to fail completely,negative
cannot afford to ever have bogus partsespecially when it comes to the rutter of the planethat can lead to the most serious consequences,negative
crimes of capitalism,negative
i thought it was wind from the f that made it uncontrollable,negative
pilots dont have the time or need to check if cvr or fdr is getting powered or not its the job of the fkin maintenance crew its not in the pilots checklist,negative
way cant you not fet the aircraft type correct it was not convair it was convair i worked on convair with r piston engines during my apprenticeship in sas,negative
when joe biden was a senator he sold out much more aircraft industry to china,negative
these airline companies are so greedy failing to spend the money for the correct part is a tragedy your dealing with lives it should be mandatory to buy from the manufacturer not some mom pop factory,negative
the f caused the crash,negative
remember this i was immediately jolted into recalling this incident better relayed by chatgpt than me and so i quote the incident youre referring to is the hyatt regency hotel disaster in kansas city missouri which occurred on july the catwalks which were part of the hotels atrium collapsed killing people and injuring over the collapse was due to a design flaw in the way the walkways were suspended specifically the failure occurred because of a faulty modification made to the connection of the walkways suspension bolts which were not designed to bear the weight they were carrying the bolts were ultimately found to be a critical factor in the tragedy watch the documentary about it and youll learn more about how these bolts were allowed to come into use,negative
so they installed temu bolts on an airplane not surprising this is why i refuse to support that trash,negative
a flight falls out of the sky and journalistic vultures immediately jump to terrorism and scaremongering a very tiny percentage of planes have been brought down by terrorism,negative
some lottery they have going,negative
thats so sad to friends both getting ready to retire,negative
never put all eggs in a single basket that too oldbroken maintainance less multidefecred aircraft,negative
thee air line owners would let the boggus parts pass,negative
whats sad about this accident is that both pilots were getting ready to retire from piloting only to be taken away by the plane having bogus parts,negative
i feel like bill and ted came up with the name bogus parts,negative
the same as air france concord,negative
bit heavy on the music in these programmes arent they other wise well put together,negative
the turbine winder is the sound the tasmanian devil makes anyone else catch that,negative
one of the hardest investigation,negative
i remember back in i was a door gunner on a uhb model bell helicopter when my crew chief mentioned another helicopterss tail boom came off in flight me not knowing anything about a helicopter decided to check our tail boom ther is four bolts holding on i saw there were cracks in the mounts that the bolts went thru our aircraft went into maintence and they were beefed up i felt better and made it thru my last four months,negative
bogus xi takes offense but i bet he doesnt poison as many americans as dupont,negative
amazing detective work id love to be one of those investigators,negative
this is the best crash investigation video that i have ever seen the skill of the investigators was amazing of course there are also many other excellent investigations but this one really stands out to me,negative
so bad guys always has a upper hand,negative
,negative
,negative
well thats kind of impossible to do when it takes a metalurgist and a scanning electron microscope to cut a part into pieces and use a several hundred thousand dollar piece of equipment and a phd to be able to spot the fake no you dont put that on the mechanic you hire a professional parts guy to check the stuff over before the parts go to the mechanic,negative
im not so sure about that the complaint of excess vibration and the broken mount of the apu is pointing to a faulty out of balance apu rotor that shook enough to break one of its mounts and eventually shake the tail structure enough to cause it to break off the plane due to fatigue cracks i am not an airplane mechanic but this theory makes sense to me so far maybe the military jet flying close enough and fast enough caused a surge to the smaller plane and the weakened tail structure failed and broke off then it probably would have been able to handle the shock if the tail wasnt already weakened due to the vibrating apu,negative
plane is always making piston engine exhaust sounds in the video but in reality it was a turboprop,negative
the flight data recorder is a delicate instrument if it suffers a severe impact the little pterodactyl taking notes inside could be injured or his chisel could even break,negative
they mentioned resonance and coupled harmonics in this video to see what resonance can cause lookup some videos of ground resonance in a helicopter its caused when the main rotors rotation becomes unbalanced and it can cause the helicopter to literally shake itself apart often within seconds thats in a perfectly fine helicopter too,negative
i have to seriously doubt they were able to find any of the bolts wtf,negative
whats a newspaper grandpa,negative
explosive from the ocean ok,negative
im guessing it is something from the f which came loose as it buzzed the airliner thats crazy unlucky the odds almost like flying at and getting pelted by a meteorite or a piece of space junk from the s,negative
didnt atc see the f on the radar screen,negative
wow this story sounds amazing because you have two completely separate issues that fed off each other to cause a plane crash by a principle called coupled harmonics the two pilots were friends and close to retirementit is like getting struck by lightning twice in the same spot you have to be extremely unlucky for these conditions to happen,negative
to win a lottery that results in your death is indeed tragic,negative
so regarding this flight people had to die because someone was able to save lets see x x dividing by that was what each life was worth has anybody gone to prison for this crime probably not,negative
oof the swollowed a whole toothpick part made me gag,negative
the s was a bad time for aeroplanes,negative
fact dig dig dig dig digand keep digging to put the blame on anything else these investigators did a great jobin doing so vibrationsvibrationsvibrationsand yet nothing was mention of the supersonic f flying too close to the aircraft,negative
what about the boeing max dropping out of the sky like lion air,negative
blasphemy against god my gosh,negative
ok so the plane crashed because of money so when are you people gonna start hating it slaves,negative
with trumps incoming deregulation purge you can kiss safety goodbye cheers from michael australia,negative
the sad thing is that lots of the crashes are happening because some one wanted to cut costincrease profit,negative
money first safety last one would think that the un safe area usa president would approve capitalism is the way to go umer isnt it,negative
all the plans that size ive travelled never have that much room between passengers,negative
that animation is harrowing i hope none of the passengers were conscious when the plane ripped apart like that falling from an airplane from thousands of feet up in the air while knowing im about to die is my greatest fear,negative
if the genuine parts manufacturer for didnt rip their customers off there wouldnt be any need to buy scrap or bogus parts ie for a x half inch bolt even made in very high grade steel is ridiculous manufactures have always vastly overpriced equipment sold to government bodies etc who hve no idea what their products should cost because the money doese t come out of their pockets so they just pay any amount and pass it on,negative
where were the bogus bolts made id put money on it in china not that its the chineses fault but they do not produce steel to this day that is worth a crap look at their warships on the oceans the steel hulls they produce are way below american steel standards made in china i dont think many of the parts came from junkyards or crashes,negative
except it wasnt a passenger jetdo your research idiots,negative
great investigation very impressive determination,negative
someone named heimdall is destined to be an investigator he will eventually see the problem,negative
where did the fake bolts come fromyup chyna,negative
capitalism,negative
this heimdal fellow simply cant speak clearly enough its very annoying,negative
its fine detective workso the f fighter had nothing to do with it pirate parts was the cause i dont think they would ever entirely stamp out that problem,negative
these investigators are geniuses,negative
finn heimdel sounds like davie,negative
the title is misleading there was no coverup,negative
very incomplete episode they never revealed what they named the ship did the shortnotice standin christen it as boaty mcboatface,negative
im not saying it was aliens but,negative
the pilots have to pay for airplane food,negative
the narrative is wrong it states the flight was flying over the north sea they were flying over the skagerrak,negative
winners of a lottery i guess its better to be a loser,negative
pulling prop hrough on a urbine,negative
one of the tail colors blue stars is of our now defunct national airline tansahsa,negative
how can you interview someone frome the plane when al wher ded,negative
replacing one bolt instead of the set of four is obviously bad practice,negative
have the boeing board seen this video,negative
yet another reason why i do not fly on paper flying is safer than driving but when a plan has a mind of its own and you happen to be on that plane your chances for survival a pretty much zero and now even the aviation parts are compromised,negative
similar things like this are still happening in todays world,negative
in the early s we were modifying a small motor used to control on helicopters a helicopter with one of our parts that we had modified ashed in los angeles california it was a news helicopter crashed into a building it was big news at the time the faa started their investigation going through each and every item extremely thorough investigation the week before they started to investigate our process they found out the cause of the helicopter crash we had spent two months preparing for the investigation not two months of working every single day it was the process of preparing that took two months due to the details the faa requires what type of cutting fluid we used the manufacture of the cutting fluid has to provide the chemicals they used to make the cutting fluid what type of tool we use to modify the motors the manufacture of the tool manufacture of the material the tool is made out of these are very thorough investigations we knew we did our job correctly however the faa doesnt care what you know they care about verifying every single detail down to the packaging we put the motors in for shipping for example putting them into plastic bags would the plastic bag have any effect on the motor the amount and type of packing material we use the manufacturer of the material etc and not only takes up a tremendous amount of our time it takes up a tremendous amount of our suppliers and our suppliers suppliers time it is incredibly detailed work for every single item until they find out the cause of the crash process of elimination every single thing they find out that was made perfectly they can cross it off of their list this is the reason these investigations take so long one or two years is not uncommon however there are rapid investigations that go much quicker due to safety concerns regarding the airlines fleets,negative
the fbi rated one of our suppliers in silicon valley and close the company down for selling fake aircraft parts after this happened the entire industry changed and documentation was required with each and every order even for hardware not going in airplanes we were given choices of the quality of hardware we were purchasing identifying the most important things how they were manufactured the type of material and the heat treating for example threads on a bolt can either be rolled or cut cutting is way more expensive they can even be ground after heat treating because the edge of the threads come to a fairly sharp point during the heat treating process that edge can easily be damaged from the heat so the bolt would be heat treated and then the threads would be brown afterheat treating for government parts we can have up to pages of documentation starting with the manufacturer of the material all the way through turning the material into hardware treating etc,negative
many of the aircraft flying for smaller less well known airlines have had a chequered career thousands of take offs and landings through short haul flights puts an enormous strain upon airframes,negative
million moving parts seems a little high unless he means when in flight in which case all the parts are moving until the plane comes to a stop on the runway,negative
i guess it has also meant that manufacturers have been able to charge outrageous prices for genuine parts so not entirely a win win situation though sometimes for instance car engine bolts are tightened till they have just started to yield in which case they should not be used again so using unknown origin bolts would be particularly risky,negative
capitalism kills,negative
engineers would not have replaced the bolts without confirming its diameter unless the bolts were of different diameter it would not allow vibrations,negative
interestingly dcs from ww are still flying with turboprops like these these are now renamed bt baselers,negative
,negative
another useless government agency that is reactive rather than proactive why do these people always end up in the public sector,negative
a long way around to get to what is in fact called feedback i think that some of these experts like their moments of fame,negative
these stories always seem to start with exotic theories of bombs missiles or sabotage but always end up being due to costcutting human error incompetence ineffective crm adverse weather or bent industry practices,negative
i heard that of spare bolts for this type of aircraft were taken from redundant supermarket trolleys,negative
i keep a list of crash causes and i check them when i get on a plane have you checked the pitot tubes did the refueller use the volume units on the docket etc now i can add have you checked the tail fin bolts are certified genuine parts,negative
conspiracy and cover up in the title are incredibly misleading neither of those were a factor in the manner people would think of those terms and i have no doubt those terms were not used for the original tv show illegal fake parts etc would be much more valid,negative
bogus parts is too scandalous identification before use needs a heroic step change across all levels cash incentives put in the right hands perhaps rather than unscrupulous criminal elements as this problem is getting clamped out its emerging the bubble is squeezing into the cash problem of dangerous builds such as boeing how can danger be kept out of the skies when quick money making is always at the buffet feast for the unscrupulous money stained with blood with the most disastrous consequences,negative
sorrycareless design no one part should be that critical more than four bolts should have been used and the bolt strength should not have been that critical half the problems of modern design result from using parts that are operating so close to max stress levels that there is no room for any error its cheaper in the factory to use special parts but in the real world outside mistakes happen designers and manufacturers like boing have to learn this lesson planes and cars must be designed for the real world,negative
,negative
ironic that the carrier was called part in air,negative
and this leads to the current situation in russia where sanctions have caused them to turn to similar actions with similar consequences those aircraft will never be accepted in iata airspace now,negative
its pathetic when the ceo takes most of the profit decides if they need to cut costs its to the costs connected to safety of others too greedy to cut his own salary,negative
they covered up the fact that the aircraft crashed due to the jetwash of the f,negative
the red head loves the power her job gives her,negative
air turbulance caused by the f is what caused the aircraft to lose control,negative
im only a minute or so into this although i like the narrators voice it irritates me that he says killermetres instead of kilometres,negative
dont forget air india kanishka which was blown up mid air,negative
why does this happen to people who are close to retirement this video is disturbing in that there are evil people in the world who will do anything for money did they enter wake turbulence from the f,negative
it is wellknown fact in the economic scientific literature that deregulation of the airline industry in the us in the s went too far for ideological reason supply side economics reaganomics contestable markets and so on against safety,negative
what coverup clickbait,negative
when i saw the video my first thought was when the f passed the plane at a very high speed that the vortex had caused the crash,negative
lmao how they are surprised air force one is using bogus parts thats how we run in america we gotta save some money and give our ppl the crappy stuff to give out to other countries the good stuff so they dont ruin us lol,negative
and the irony is that the passengers were all lottery winners who would have thought that the prize would lead to such catastrophe,negative
if i won a company prize and it required me to get on a little year old propeller plane from a noname airline like that i woulda been like nope keep the prize no way am i getting on that thing,negative
previous a carshower unit fix is similar price,negative
how could they let pilots only months away from retirement fly the same flight havent they seen lethal weapon,negative
i guess i stop flying,negative
what a forced theory about combined resonance they woul never admit the truth we have no idea what the reason was,negative
how do you even class a bolt as counterfeit i dont believe people would go around scrap yards looking for shoddy parts thats ridiculous whatever the reality shame for all involved rip,negative
i had not heard about this crash before glad ive learned about it now my thoughts go to the victims and their families,negative
i dont fly i hate it phobic no just a healthy respect for gravity,negative
that map of europe at oh my,negative
the only reason people were atrested was because of the tureat the af i doubt anybody wouldve cared if it was just the partnair crash think of all the times other crashes have happened and recommendations made of which some aurlines still havent fullfilled the recommendations put forward by investigators,negative
imagine being a norwegian at that time and finding that one of your countrys major companies needs to hire a whole new set of staff,negative
thats a lie because what about the airplane pilot that got sucked out of the window and survived,negative
excellent information and narration condolences to the families of the deceased and the loved ones,negative
these guys could find that needle in a hay stack they are amazing you safe so many lives by doing what you do you all deserve a medal,negative
if the cvr had nothing on it after the flight took off how did the airline know the norwegian f had passed by in the investigation they dont mention except for an unidentified object they saw on a military radar i too like this channel and their casting is perfect the actors and the real persons look almost similar,negative
safer now well not quite,negative
airforce not so secure after all at least in the past,negative
situation normal to get the government to do anything make it touch them directly they would have swept it under the rug if the air force was not involved,negative
narrator and call into question the safety of one of the worlds most important planes air force one narrator theyre shocked when they discover that bogus parts have been found on what is supposed to be the most tightly controlled plane in the world air force one,negative
how sad,negative
this series is the very best i admire seeing how regular people who have excellent work ethics use them so well i wish i could thank each and every one of them,negative
crappy parts swap is just on small airlines some of the big airlines will scavenge parts even from crashed planes if they pass inspection,negative
the investigations of these older passenger planes are so much more interesting and i love experts coming out of retirement because they are the last with knowledge on a lost art,negative
you can tell this took place before norway became one of the wealthiest countries in the world since even their pm was flying this ancient beat up plane,negative
the counterfeit bolts were intact but fuselage got cut in pieces why,negative
i guess im the only one who immediately said they got in his jet wash yeah i guess ive watched too much top gun eta i still think the f played some part in this like it was traveling too close too fast and the wind from it is what finally broke the parts in the other plane,negative
my question is really why is said bolt selling for likely because it is for an aircraft same part same rockwell hardness spec diameter thread pitch etc and sold to industrial sector it might sell for i understand the parts made for aircraft might fly people but the same spec industrial parts might actually protect much more lives than an aircraft so that argument is countered some it reminds me of the same argument of why prescriptions are more expensive in some places like america than they are in others when they cost the same to manufacture i get liability insurance is a big cost and is a factor in both examples,negative
i dont like the crashes ending with sadness and people death i like only the episodes with happy ending and people survived,negative
the only thing wrong with the plane is the people who service them trouble is people pay with their lives for companies cutting corners,negative
pilots are murderers,negative
that maintenance faulty with terrible fake parts nobody like bogus parts that very bad,negative
but why had the doors fallen off mid flight insert boeing joke,negative
bravo to save on some nutz and boltz the airliner lost a plane worth tens of millions of dollars had to pay out tens of millions more to settle law suits and a reluctant apology to the survivorsas for the air force one having deez nutz and boltz i have not been too excited about all deez presidents lately anyway let their rich donors worry about them,negative
if god had meant man to fly and people still arent getting it,negative
md just wanted to sell the plane knowing very well the problems with the plane i came to canada on board one of them in and by then it seems the problems had been fixed,negative
this is why i dont fly,negative
look at this look at this,negative
not suicide by american pilot oh they are white can not be only asian african or middle eastern pilots commit suicide,negative
such a heartbreaking story,negative
im just gonna say i thought was the worst planes crashing in history because they didnt have any bodies to be found crazy,negative
the fake drama contributes nothing to the story it just makes it look like a shit sitcom,negative
im nonononononononononono,negative
police,negative
not,negative
deep stall wasnt a joke,negative
lol that music at the end,negative
my dad was supposed to be on that flight but something got changed so he didnt make the flight wonder what life would have been like if he had made the flight,negative
and no one considered the possibility that things sometimes doesnt appear to be what they seem,negative
no the deadliest was in tenerife,negative
brought down by powers outside our human control bentov was on that flight makes a person wonder,negative
this reminds me of the th june crash of air india flight in ahmedabad,negative
why middle landing gear,negative
i was in th grade elementary school what alot of great memories huh,negative
horrible god bless the souls and letnlove live forever,negative
such an awful few minutes bcs the ppl knew they are gg to die,negative
why did it bankwith one engine out it can still flypity,negative
in memory for the people have died,negative
why dont engineers make an ignition system,negative
why did they go higher also why did they bank right did they stall,negative
shit like this makes me scared of flying,negative
nooooooooooooooooooooo,negative
uhm thats not the worst aviation disaster in us history but keep telling false information thats cool,negative
my mom was pregnant with me when this happened she could see the smoke from our house in elk grove village,negative
ive kept a promise to myself that i wont be amongst those who complain about amenities food leg room on flights perspective is everything,negative
we were heading out that day for long memorial day weekend of white water rafting in wisconsin when we entered the horrible thick black smoke heading to the expressway the smell of jet fuel such a horrific loss,negative
itzhak bentov,negative
this video is awful no information on why this happened just the drama,negative
what caused it,negative
ursache gier wie fast immer,negative
i knew a pastor from a church my family attended when me and my brother were kids he was on this flight he was a good man,negative
one foto shows an md not an dc what is wrong,negative
my sister was supposed to be on that flight it was headed to los angeles she changed her plans at the last minute when i think about it it gives me the chills,negative
i really dont think bracing will help,negative
being able to watch it happen as a passenager is a next level scary,negative
on the upside they missed the trailer park so hundreds of unemployed people continued to claim benefits,negative
when this happened i was in th grade and we watched the coverage for hours one year later took a class trip to dc and at that time everyone feared the dc,negative
i remember this horrible accident i remember hearing the explosion and dropping to my knees and when i got up i saw in a distance huge clouds of black smoke,negative
i got suggested this video after the air india flight got down this month earlierand surprisingly both of the cases are quite similar,negative
meanwhile ahmedabad crash airindia,negative
so sad,negative
used to fly aa or ua out of ohare all the time i only hope people realize that the skies have been made safer after every accident the data from the black boxes helps ensure that,negative
ahmedabad india plan crash,negative
dc is a terrible plane,negative
do planes crashing into skyscrapers not count as aviation disasters,negative
om shanti,negative
similar situation and fate with ai what a painful incident both of these are completely heartwrenching,negative
bro i just saw this before my flight on american airlines to o hare,negative
now something similar happened in ahmedabad india on june its so heartbreaking all passengers except one died in this crash families are ruined may things like this never ever happen in future god bless everyone,negative
iconic pic,negative
im sorry some of you in the comments are liars my uncles brothers best friend was the pilot,negative
is this video real,negative
errie its so much like the june air india boeing plane crash,negative
the worst aviation disaster was two planes flying into the world trade center how dare you,negative
my family and i were supposed to be on that flight and canceled last minute to take the train instead so my handicapped grandma could come ever since then my life has been a final destination movie wild to think about and such an absolute tragedy,negative
this is extremely sad it is similar to what happened yesterday in ahmedabad india an ai airline crash,negative
how it can disappear in such a small pieces with all those lifes in it and all that material,negative
who all here after the devastating air india flight crash incident here in india its nothing short of a shock to see this has happened before in a different country,negative
such a horrible tragedy that shouldve been prevented but i would like to know what complete idiot decided to build a huge trailer park right next to an airport that couldve been even more catastrophic,negative
the same incident took place yesterday here in india,negative
im sorryi know ill get crap for saying thisand i admit i am narrow minded but i dont get people who enjoy flyingits so unnaturali have only flown under heavy sedation because my family needed me to be somewhere faster than i could driveim a lifetime mechanic i know how things worki know how things wear out and fatiguei know of professionals bull crap their way into most jobspeople liehave bad daysdrinkdrugsthere are way to many variables for me i will never fly againif i die on my harley or in my car thats on me,negative
is that a body still in a seat at the mark i cant tell,negative
basic mechanics mistake as i recall,negative
wasnt a bigger disaster,negative
lets never remount an aircraft engine ever again using a forklift,negative
hmmm worst,negative
poor people,negative
thats scary,negative
i worked miles from ohare and saw the flames in the sky,negative
this is my sons account im writing it on but oh my god i cant believe i havent seen this i was a little boy and both parents grandma brother and sister were on that flight i was a little boy i remember it like it was yesterday i was crying nonstop because it was the only family that i have had then i was put up in a foster home until i was on my own at but i made some freinds i was there for years and constantly got reminded of it by everyone because it was the biggest thing around love you mom hope im making you proud,negative
my dog pudgy died on this flight,negative
still dont understand how american airlines is still in business youd think with everything thats happened over the years someone would shut it down,negative
thank god they were able to avoid that trailer park as bad as this was it could have been much worse prayers go out to the passengers and their families,negative
famous last words brace brace brace,negative
them poor people,negative
never would have happened on my watch,negative
demon horns,negative
help me mama we are crashing,negative
all went to hell,negative
demons,negative
i thought the worst aviation disaster was the attacks,negative
unnecessary loss because companies wanna be cheap i hate big corporations,negative
the worst disaster in aviation history happened september,negative
the worst air disaster in history was at the airport on the island of tenerife between airlines klm and panam that video is also on youtube under us law airplane accidents fall under strict liability,negative
my aunt and uncle were eyewitnesses to the accident,negative
a friend of mine michael laughlin we were in high school at the time took the photograph,negative
how did the engine fail on aa airlines,negative
bro i had a fucking american airlines commercial before this,negative
now i havent watched the video but i must say im pretty sure the worst aviation disaster in us history happened in nyc and dc,negative
i was literally only blocks away i swerved into a gas station where i was stuck for hours i jumped out the station attendant and i are looking at each other and i said did we just get nuked it was that bad i was working for a professional photographic servic that did development and printing at around midnight someone knocked on our door it was the photographer that took that famous shot calld the owner he said print it make me a copy of ach it was done in hours and on the cover of the paper just hours later,negative
i was literally only blocks away i swerved into a gas station where i was stuck for hours i jumped out the station attendant and i are looking at each other and i said did we just get nukd it was that bad,negative
so wasnt,negative
i remember this this one has always stuck with me all those people are in my heart,negative
i never seen this flight plane crash incident happen cos my mom was months pregnant with me but when i watched in on national geographic this happens rip to those involved in the plane crash,negative
im not sure whether youve heard of a small incident referred to as,negative
,negative
did they kick the right rudder out i feel like that would have helped,negative
i worked in an office building just a few miles away we could see the smoke will never forget,negative
rich watson was our soccer coach in palos verdes his son was on our team great man,negative
its crazy how alot of peoples family members friends all have died on flight im super sorry for your guys loss,negative
ntsbaar is pages long,negative
we had a family flying in for a reunion people to be exact,negative
maybe wanna reconsider this title so disrespectful,negative
title legid dont know though this was a horrible disaster what about the panamklm double jumbojet disaster at tenerife,negative
rest in peace to the people who died tragically years ago today and prayers and comfort go out to the family friends and the countless numbers of people for whom the pain and sorrow is still raw we will never forget,negative
i was at work when this happened how sad that money has to control almost everything in life lack of adequate maintenancecutting corners the example here heart breaking,negative
this is so fake this is a dramatic recreation,negative
womp womp,negative
i was the pilot,negative
it had to have terrifying for those souls who knew what was going to happen may they rest in eternal peace,negative
im going on vacation at the end of june and im keeping my feet on solid ground the friendly skies are a thing of the past,negative
we will never forget the souls on,negative
md,negative
my workmate had just dropped he nephew of at ohare for that flight im sure she heard on the radio the horrific news on her drive home she was devastated,negative
a guy who was soon to become a coworker and one of my best friends was in the airport bar having a drink and a hamburger waiting for his flight to a job interview at our engineering firm in minneapolis he had just flown into chicago on american from detroit and some of the passengers from that flight had connected with aa greg watched this whole thing happen knowing that some of the people hed just flown with a half hour ago were on that plane to los angeles its something that stayed with him as long as i knew him,negative
this is what happens when you put profit ahead of peoplefunctionalitysafety,negative
wearing seatbelts in cars can significantly increase your chances of survival in a crash but are more akin to window dressing in aviation crashes,negative
i remember this so well i was a flight attendant based in chicago,negative
umm thats a md,negative
heavenly father bless each lost soul and their family,negative
my ex neighbours sister had a dog called bruno before he was adopted by my ex neighbours sister he lived with an older couple in ohio the older couples grandson who looked after bruno went to college and his roommate josh told him that his dad knew a lady from work whos sister had a boyfriend whos brother was on that flight,negative
i was stuck in traffic on which crosses the end of the runway used as take off that day and witnessed exactly that scene i was also at a light when a plane out of midway flew in front of me and crashed blocks east left of me i havent been in a plane since the second one,negative
it was the real deal full blown poltergeist i was just happy to have a place to live after being homeless,negative
i told him how i was in his room once when he wasnt home and how i heard like girls laughing all around me and checked the windows and how no one was there not even putting two and two together we both had that happen to us but never knew until i told him he said he felt chills up his spine when i told him that,negative
my brother was in tears when i came home from the nightshift he said it was a little girl in a white dress jumping on and off the washing machine next to the blanket that unfolded itself that i just so happen to be staring at when he was telling me this i came back to check if my mail was there and the first words out of the ladies mouth when she answered the door was im a medium did you see tue ghost its a little girl in a white dress,negative
the things i witnessed at that trailer park was nothing short of horrific i would hear footsteps running up and down the trailer children laughing i even saw a blanket unfold itself,negative
dcs had a lot of issues,negative
losing power from one engine does cause the plane to bank unless its the middle engine on a dc which it wasnt in this case its called asymmetric thrust what is this channel,negative
frightening what did the forensic investigation reveal,negative
actually is the worst but yea,negative
yes lets fire some inspectors and mechanics we need to cut costs,negative
so sad and unfortunately its becoming more and more a possibility again should we not straighten out our air traffic controlers situation,negative
i was only when this tragic plane crash occurred so i dont remember it rip to the people who lost their lives that horrible day,negative
as long as smithsonian has been recreating air disasters youd think they could accurately depict flight crews communications and recreations its not just cheesy acting its at times misleading for the sake of over dramatizing for tv these victims deserve better,negative
two people on the ground who worked in a mechanic shop also died my friends nephew would have been there but for a dental appointment the toothache saved his life and his moms who would have been on site at that time to pick him up from work,negative
this story is wrong the plane cleared touhy ave and crashed into a police training area killing some people in the trailer park it did not hit a hangar,negative
my brother was sitting on his balcony at his apartment in des plaines and he watched the whole thing he was needless to say shocked,negative
as a frequent business traveller it hits me always hard to see or read about this kind of accidents may these souls rest in peace,negative
i remember this,negative
i believe that flight was the first flight to have live feed of the take off for all passengers to see they literally saw everything the pilots were seeing,negative
what this video didnt tell was that the engine fell off and although im not sure but the investigation found there was evidence of improper repair procedures which caused cracks in engine mount that may have contributed to this disaster,negative
were in the alternate timeline,negative
i know nothing about airport logistics or flying airplanes but to me it seems like to much activity in to small an area larger more spread out air ports that dont utilize strip crossings seem like the answer in addition to spreading air traffic out better between airports rather than putting more on one piticular one along with tower operators not doing actual checks before giving clearance,negative
crazy bro,negative
in video a few metres thumbnail feets,negative
then it didnt happen so lets just move on,negative
that never,negative
tbh the last one it kinda boggles me that this is allowed in vis conditions thankfully fedex got to see them otherwise that would have been a crash i would say in low vis condition there can only be one plane assigned to a runway so if one is cleared to land another cant be cleared for takeoff even if the landing one is miles final the miles is the controller decicion distance in low vis so if he allows a takeoff with a plane cleared to land on a mile final by miles he has to tell the takeoff one expedite takeoff if the landing plane crosses the miles the landing one gets the abort landinggo around call only in low visibility,negative
actually a couple days ago from here b almost collided with a delta,negative
the plane did what it was told the air traffic controller said left at kilo thats what they did the controller should have said right at kilo,negative
dei procedures implemented by the air traffic recruiters are to blame they massively lowered the standards in order to attract poc to the roles as part of a diversity drive you might roll your eyes reading this comment but its true many news channels did investigations about it,negative
this is insane props to air traffic control,negative
just realized there was another close call at sfo this year in although it was during takeoff and not landing man,negative
,negative
can i ask what kind of video is this i mean the concept the cinematic view i want to lern how make trhis kind of video anyone pleasew,negative
you can see the nd plane throw on all his taxi and takeoff lights,negative
tenerf at the worst,negative
so this happened on july and i am watching on july coincidence,negative
i was watching this at pm,negative
sounds like the story to western flight,negative
if this animation is accurate why did the one controller tell the plane being taxied to stop in the middle of the intersection,negative
world record for maximum separation at sfo,negative
the worst crash that never happened the brain aint braining,negative
in fact that the near crash with dal did actually happen with two boeing at tenerife airport in march with pan am and klm and was called the worst ground crash which is actually true,negative
a few meters wow,negative
seems a bit weird that you wouldnt have some sort of lighting still on the closed runway for example all red lighting at the bottom,negative
buddy the largest accident in general aviation you mean the largest accident in commercial aviation,negative
this couldve been just as bad as the tenerife airport disaster,negative
crap noise that the presenter thinks is music is poorly added,negative
it happened in but the airplanes actually hit in japan,negative
,negative
canada isnt even a country lol,negative
hey can you do charki dadri disaster in nebula,negative
i didnt know near misses were this frequent im having goosebumps,negative
harshvikas he has take footage from your video n content too see to it,negative
dont let tennis ball see this,negative
i shouldnt be watching this a week before i go on a plane,negative
they should just bar southwest from such privileges in the future all southwest must wait no matter how long they must wait for as a direct consequence of this,negative
dei is why youre having an increasing number of close calls,negative
oii philippine airlines,negative
one controller should never be handling all traffic at an airport with the traffic levels of sfo regardless if it was a quieter period or not i would even argue two or more controllers should be manning the towers at airports with much lower traffic levels than san francisco the atc shortage will cost lives if we continue to cut corners,negative
,negative
how is this crash if it never happened,negative
for the fedex southwest incident i have a fun fact for you tcas doesnt work as you would expect it during landing and takeoff below feet as its partialy deactivated or the warning sounds are muffeled so that pilots can concentrate on landing and taking off,negative
what do you mean by the worst crash if it never happened,negative
there was a pretty bad crash at haneda in because a plane misunderstood the towers instructions and was slightly in the runway where an a was approaching,negative
bucks a month for this type of content sign me uppp,negative
scary ty for the vid,negative
this crash never happened,negative
bro it never happen,negative
if it never happen how was it close,negative
where did you get the music for this video,negative
and this is why you keep your seatbelt on during taxi most accidents happen during take off landing and taxi so i never understood how people immediately unfasten their seatbelts as soon as the plan hits the ground and remember to keep the windows open during these times so the crew can notice anything weird on the taxiway,negative
easily remedied by atc simply saying cleared to land on runway r runway l is closed or something along those lines as a headsup in case the pilots are suffering from fatigue after even a couple hours of flying our pilots in the army are always tired and mentally fatigued after they are done flying for the nightday its incredibly lucky that the other pilots were able to speak up in time,negative
if you hire more white people you will have less accidents,negative
how does a grown say free instead of three free isnt a number,negative
its terrifying how one small error can lead to such a massive disaster the chain of events here is chilling,negative
the crazy part is that i regularly fly into this airport because i have family near the area and i fly into this airport in summer so this hits realllyyy close to home,negative
still dont understand how we continue to have these issues insane,negative
regulations are written in blood,negative
bro,negative
in the jfk example wouldnt that be atcs fault due to them saying take a left at kilo,negative
dei,negative
you called it its worse now and the hudson river incident just highlights the problem more,negative
i leanred a lot not all airports are places i want to go,negative
you best expect that incursion number to jump up thanks to dictator trump,negative
how about looking into the long term effects of marijuana on a pilots performance since canada legalized weed accidents have increased involving canadians,negative
the best part of this video is the commentator not bring able to pronounce ws and ts its hilarious not cause im teasing or nothing just cause he is a commentator that cant pronounce certain letters it makes it more human and i respect him even more in a world of ai that does awkward pauses and are all a version of different popular reproduction voices that get really old and sound awkward as ai isnt good enough yet commentating i hope isnt a dying breed and people appreciate homies like the guy keeping it real and got my sub and like he is on point in these videos,negative
now reagan has soo many problems that have cost lives,negative
close one,negative
in the fedexsouthwest scenario as rvr was it can be said that southwest was most likely doing a low visibility take off lvto which cannot be done as a rolling take off meaning you have to stop on the runway before applying take off thrust as it has been said it would have been better to wait for the fedex to land and line up after them this way having a good separation,negative
i know this,negative
wrong landingggggg,negative
pray for air canada,negative
why dont they just install literal traffic lights like you see on roads keep em all red at all intersections except green on paths where a plane is suppose to go most pilots also drive cars so are already hardwired from childhood to understand a red and green circle traffic lights and red and green turn signals,negative
does anyone know what actually happened to the pilotsair traffic controller were they fired,negative
most lessons will be forgotten soon enough just let politicians work it out,negative
at least noone deid,negative
what i find confusing about the austin incident is you need to protect the ils during a cat iii approach at my airport the runway needs to be clear by the time an arrival is final during cat iii operations cant see how miles and rolling wouldnt cause problematic disruptions in the ils signals for fedex,negative
ai voice with a lisp,negative
we have pilots who shouldnt be pilots anyone can become anything they want no you sgould he qualified for the job high stress level jobs should require ppl who dont drink or drug mental health cleared and a regular wellfar check many accidents wouldnt accure pilots and alcohol big problems,negative
bro look at this video bro,negative
if the worst crash never actually happenedthen how is it the worst crash,negative
it was impossible when he missed pal the a it was ft not feet,negative
dei hires cant hurt you every year since it became a thing weve been getting record breaking close calls in aviation and even actual crashes thank you americans for decisively leading the war against dei we know you started it but hey a mistake corrected is a good thing in my book,negative
i think about this every time im taxiing so scary how close it was,negative
who else come from the reels,negative
my question is why the pilots did not recognise the other planes strobes,negative
pete buttplug,negative
crazy i only clicked on this video bc i could tell that was sfo in the thumbnail my mom used to work there and i go to go up into the control tower right around this time,negative
thats strange fedx and sw incident sw pilots when giving clearance for takeoff turn and the on the runway and go been on so many of them,negative
delta pilot chillest mofo on earth,negative
holy shit i was gripping my chair on that first one before i read the title never happened i thought i clicked on ever happened,negative
its pretty clear why the pilot taxied onto the wrong runway it was a woman pilot explains the whole thing,negative
im glad that some miscommunications can be solved easily and instantly these controllers and captains did a good job very professional but the miscommunication never stops and the doubt with the weather and the unbroadened view i just want these issues to be solved for more safety and less accidents or close calls like these to happen,negative
the pilots almost recreated the past,negative
why didnt air traffic control tell them about rl was being maintain,negative
pete buttadud was a disgrace,negative
i live right about where the bottom point of the star closest to the middle of the screen where the arrow is pointing,negative
i dont understand how they cannot see the difference between runway lighting and taxi way lighting theyre even two different colors,negative
bro is landing on the taxiway what a silly guy bro is landing on the taxiway,negative
love the videos but teasing the crash followed by nebula propaganda is so annoying,negative
love love love pete buttigieg,negative
could all be avoided with smarter avionics st one newer private planes have a display that can show you a d screen of where you are and the runways they would be able to see that they arent lined up why doesnt airbus and boeing have this nd one those same screens also show you all the taxiways instead of figuring out where to turn on the taxiways which is confusing they should just have it on their screen all the directions like navigation on a car it should be sent to their planes digitally instead of using old school voice commands from atc which is prone to mistakes rd those same screens should show you all the planes around you so that they can see theres a plane on the runway even in extreme fog,negative
why do you sound like a villager,negative
hey i live on san francisco sfo,negative
the quality of these videos is so high its honestly incredible,negative
that ual pilot is such a fucking boss has an airplane heading straight towards him and just makes calm npc remarks you would hear in flight simulator,negative
im surprised that they didnt see in their notams that they didnt have the big glowing x in front of the runway indicating that its not in use and that they didnt have the ils lined up at all,negative
dei hires baby,negative
cross l at kilo american heavy immediately crosses l at juliet come on you even repeated the correct instructions back,negative
air canada flight was a nearmiss incident that occurred on july at san francisco international airport heres what happened the flight an airbus a was cleared to land on runway r but mistakenly lined up with parallel taxiway c where four fully loaded passenger airplanes were stopped awaiting takeoff clearance the crew initiated a goaround after spotting aircraft lights and receiving a warning from air traffic control and another pilot according to the national transportation safety board ntsb the plane descended to feet above the ground before starting to climb missing collision with one of the aircraft on the taxiway by just feet probable cause the ntsb determined the probable cause was the flight crews confusion of the runway with the taxiway due to ineffective review of notams the crew didnt notice that runway l was closed failure to use ils the crew didnt tune in the instrument landing system frequency for backup guidance pilot fatigue the captain had been awake for hours and the first officer had no significant rest for hours aftermath the incident led to changes in air canadas approach procedures and training as well as recommendations to the federal aviation administration faa to improve safety measures such as enhanced notam system to prioritize and present relevant information more effectively airport safety enhancements to alert controllers of potential conflicts between runway and taxiway movements crew resource management to reduce expectation bias and improve situational awareness,negative
its insane to me how murrica allows two planes being cleared on the same runway this is a violation of the rules used anywhere else,negative
if you observe an anomaly speak up it may just save your life it may also save hundreds of lives,negative
bro could of just said this fling was almost about to hit this flight and was feet away bro bro made a whole story welll done neo,negative
i would have been screaming my lungs out meanwhile the atc yeah i saw that,negative
yea im prolly done flying homestly the older ive got the more id just rather have my life in my own hands no matter how many statistics come out about how safe flyinig is they are all just propaganda of course more ppl die in car crashes however in you had a chance to survive an auto accident whereas you have less than a chance to survive an airplane crash and thats for every crash ever even runway accidents,negative
and to think the trump administration thinks its a good time to cut air traffic controllers,negative
can we include real speed simulations like we saw in the very first one or were they already real speed,negative
oh naw why did it happen on my bday,negative
dei hire,negative
i could hear the dei in towers voice on the fedex one,negative
oopsie,negative
i know its easy to judge in hindsight but it seems to me that choosing to land in the dark when there was a perfectly lit runway is completely absent of logic,negative
anybody else watching this in this video seems so quaint even more naive here from the future thr number of crashes just in the past few weeks april is shocking,negative
dont worry doge will save us,negative
pinoy pride,negative
theres good reason why a remarkable number of pilots are afraid to fly unless theyre in the pilots seat its a nerve wracking job fun relaxing and addictive but it can be extremely stressful during to and landing if youre on a flight and you see someone who is nervous and fidgety during to and landing chances are good that theyre a pilot its a minority of pilots but more than youd think especially if youre also a pilot,negative
no wonder why americans believe the wright brothers invented the airplane they dont know how to fly,negative
this was one day after i was born,negative
a crash just like the first one actually happened a couple years ago it wasnt on a taxiway but on the runway as one plane was departing another one was landing the departing plane struck the fuselage of the landing plane on the approach with its tail fin i remember that none of the people in the departing plane with the ripped off tailfin survived as it crashed after the runway but dont remember what happened to the other one,negative
reduce the background music hard to listen with headphones,negative
watching this after the heli crash at the same airport,negative
imagine telling him about the amount of plan crashesaccidents in the first couple months of,negative
why dont you use the metric system so everyone can understand you,negative
for operational reasons ie to make things easier for the airport rather than safer for the planes happens so often and so does trying to push departures in front of arrivals another stupid action which will one day probably cause another disaster if they dont stop it,negative
meanwhile here in,negative
tenerife,negative
true,negative
watching this after the devastating plane crashes is just eerie,negative
runray,negative
hes on the taxi way in a sing song voice like he didnt just prevent the biggest mass casualty in commercial aviation history,negative
ill have a number for you to call,negative
,negative
the fact that the ad on this is airline manager,negative
its a small detail but i appreciate the correct pronunciation of toronto,negative
two words morbid curiosity,negative
phony plane crashes usually dont pan out the naudets filmed one in and caught the detonation of the north tower you must remember them no,negative
maximum sfo separation,negative
emojis you didnt know existed or forgot scroll almost there,negative
the single cause of airport ground and air near misses is the modern busyness syndrome the close scheduling the intense number of flights per hour this comes from the high number of passengers travelling these days their selfish expectations for endless convenient flight times airline greed for high turnover just relax everybody the world will not stop if you fly mins later than youd like to just reducing airport busyness by would increase safety by a lot say a minute minimum between every take off and landing rather than minute but of course i would never expect to see that,negative
pilot erro on this hellios crash,negative
they need video cameras in the cockpit,negative
so heartbreaking,negative
monkey swinging,negative
small mistakes and misunderstandings,negative
robots from construction to flights this accident was totally preventable,negative
truckers are required to do a physical walk around their rigs passengers spot structural damage as they board but are reticent to say something,negative
airlines make apocalyto sacrifices look like a friendly family picnic in comparison,negative
foooooolish people unbelievable uneducated,negative
we were on a training mission several of the medical crew were standing at the aft end of the airplane talking and laughing we suddenly realized were experiencing hypoxia we notified the pilots we discovered that the ramp was not completely shut resulting in loss of oxygen we got rolls of toilet paper stuffed it in the space and wet the paper resulting in the space being sealed and return of normal breathable air,negative
incompetent pilots too proud to listen to air control and too proud to even learn to speak proper english,negative
whoever wrote the commentary should take some grammar lessons the reason isbecause no,negative
so i switch i freaking switch is responsible for the crash just a switch omg,negative
in his grief that poor dad must be very proud of his brave beautiful son so very sad i remember this disaster clearly as i knew someone who lived in athens at the time i shared a student house with him anapfsou en eirini to all those who perished that day,negative
omg,negative
land engineer killed all,negative
copilot has a cool name would opening a cockpit window help even at that altitude,negative
rip for everyone that died that day,negative
honestly u scare me cause i wannabe a pilot,negative
its so sad that i think andreas was the villain here but turns out not,negative
this was totally preventable the engineers procedures pilot procedures pilots presence of mind warning messagesso many things had to go wrong at the same timemay they rest in peace,negative
how sad so many lives lost for a mistake that should not have happened may all these souls be blessed and rest in peace,negative
meanwhile the guy who forgot the switch get some tan on the beach also not including oxygen check switch on depart checks list procedure is,negative
just poor airmanship,negative
this was devastating andreas had such aspirations a good head on his shoulders hes a true hero for his efforts,negative
minutes of air doesnt seem like it is enough especially since apparently the pilots wont necessarily know if the masks come down because its a multipurpose error light and then they end up suffocating too losing focus and concentration along the way seems like a poorly thought out system,negative
awful audio,negative
is it apropiate to watch this even if tomorrow i have a flight,negative
he must have been desperate,negative
i think about of these long winded ads need to be banned they all completely ignore the basic presentation rule tell them what you are going to tell themthen tell themand finally tell them what you told them instead they blah blah blah endlessly until finally trying to sell you their book or a bottle of their latest snake oil,negative
what i dont understand is how this was possible two pilots and neither of them thought about the cause neither did reconigze the symptoms of oxygen shortage which i find strange cause its part of their training,negative
did the engineer go to prison,negative
,negative
,negative
andreas was a hero regardless of the outcome his father can be proud of his son i have watched many air disaster videos they are always caused by a series of unfortunate mistakes its seldom just one cause this was terrible and so avoidable i hope they have upgraded the auto functions of all aircraft,negative
jesus why is there no backstop that would prevent the plane to liftoff if the switch is on manual,negative
nothing about flying is safe,negative
hopefully now the oxygen masks now release automatically in the cockpit and pilots are trained to check all switches before entering the runway,negative
i wanted to know what happened to the mechanic who failed to change back oxygen to automatic this is why i always say most accidents are acts of negligence or incompetence they should be called tragedy instead of accident,negative
so what was done to prevent this from happening again,negative
so u tellin me these pilots just forgot one of the most important thing about flying they should have felt that they were running low on oxygen as they ascendthey still should have enough time to check that pressure valve before they faint,negative
kader,negative
preflight routine checks must be done twice firstly by two pilots who wont be flying the plane and secondly by those who will be flying lastly the error warnings must be verbose,negative
the heavenly father jehovah takes them before they feel anything such is his love same as air india on the th june,negative
why do i watch this before sleeping,negative
one of the most haunting air crash stories its always stuck with me,negative
wsiwazii,negative
just one switch led to that crash how in the world with all of the warnings did they not notice it my prayers with all on board and the families,negative
im not a pilot in my opinion when that alarm started going off for safety of everyone i dont understand why the pulot and copilot didnt start a plan on trying to landwhy not radio air traffic control for finding lication to land when alarm started going off the safety of everyone should come first not keep having alarm going off trying to keep going was it pride i dont understand,negative
why such dumbas and egoistic pilots are allowed to fly a freaking aircraft,negative
double check,negative
maybe if the attendant relays the situation on what happens in the cabin maybe theres a chance that they will figure it out,negative
sad,negative
is yhis for real ot is a joke,negative
what a beautiful brave young man he tried everything he could whilst also living the disaster of having to lose his girlfriend and all those alive in that cursed plane before his eyes btw wasnt it ground engineers fault to have the switch left on in manual mode was he punished sorry for cabin crew already struggling with accent problem hypoxia and misinterpretation,negative
unbelievable the oxygen masks system knew more about the air pressure condition than the pilots,negative
how many years in jail did this idiot of a maintenance engineer get for not setting the pressurization back to auto,negative
so the engineer conducting the cabin pressure test did not turn the manual switch to auto which ultimately led to everyones demise,negative
one question why his may day call was not heard by anyone,negative
total human error,negative
tf why alexander the macedonian is on greek plane,negative
the music should be a background noise not foreground,negative
a special salute to the flight attendant andreas,negative
so glad to have known the story of this brave man who tried to save lives until his last breath and of all the crew and passengers who silently lost their lives may they all rest in peace and to andreass family and loved ones he was an incredibly brave man and i hope you find the strength and courage to deal with his loss,negative
the investigation and reenactment was very comprehensive and detailed,negative
andreass experience flying and scuba diving had to be what kept him awake long enough to try and save everyone he died a hero,negative
i guess there should be protocol for airplane pilots to study all the air crashes in the history of avionics so that they can be open to any kind of problem faced during flight and have a slight more chance of securing the plane,negative
when i heard somebody moving i assumed it was sb who got lucky having enough oxygen then trying to safe the plan by bringing it to lower altitude,negative
as a flight attendant i can confirm that this wouldnt happen today one of the very first actions we take is to call the flight deck and check that their oxygen is on if no response we have a procedure for emergency access to the flight deck we are also trained in how to fit the pilots eros masks,negative
whyyyyyyyyyy,negative
this is one nightmare flight for the air steward trying to control a plane full of sitting corpses,negative
what i dont understand is that why didnt they turn back the moment the alarm flashed they couldve turned around because knowing the time the controls couldnt have frozen over and that was before the cabin depressurisation turn around and go back to cyprus,negative
if the pilot had checked the pressurization panel like suggested and flipped it to auto this ends entirely not tragically unfortunately by then the pilot was too occupied with circuit breakers and in his oxygen deprived brain just couldnt comprehend this situation is all around sad,negative
so heartbreaking,negative
this sooo beyond sad for so many reasons but because it didnt need to happen at all,negative
whats with the weird audio level crossovers in these videos,negative
they were dead or out before they hit no way to go though because you cant breathe,negative
problem with doing a pressure test on the ground is that you cant replicate the effects of the low temperature it can appear to seal on the ground and still leak like a sieve when the door shrinks due to extreme cold i used to taxi commercial aircraft when i worked in maintenance including doing high speed taxi tests following major overhaul the failure to switch the pressurization back to auto is unthinkable but so too is the behavior of the flight crew they bear equal responsibility part of the preflight checklist on any airliner is setting cabin pressurization to auto,negative
souls lost so unnecessary,negative
and why wasnt the check controllers not held responsible for leaving it on manual when they checked the plane bad pilot as well he shouldv immediately checked all panels and reyurned to the airport immediately when lights gave warning unbelievable that many of these flight crashes are caused by human error or bad pilots,negative
ay its giving this is my day to shine,negative
such poor design,negative
why not say low air pressure,negative
i am confused but why did the flight attendants not notify the captain of the occurrence with the oxygen mask im sure it might have been helpful may their souls find rest,negative
so the guy that fixed the plane at fault wow their no sheet to check that switch,negative
great inquiry master mindbravo team,negative
didnt s have a cabin altitude alert,negative
andreas was a hero a genius an aspiring individual who had to take his dream into a nightmare and could not save all that he loved and all those that he wanted to live and fly for how truly depressing a legend in aviation,negative
strange that there is no direct warning that air pressure in low the warnings are confusing,negative
it is the engineers blunder of not turning the air pressure system back from manual into auto after security clearance,negative
please reduce the voice of the person being interviewed so that we can hear the voiceover translation,negative
audio is so bad,negative
why is it so hard to find the actual date of this horrible event helios airways flight august th went down due to crew incapacitation to ground engineer not switching the switch back to its proper position after doing test then the flight crew missed it on their checklists because we are after all all human this is one of the biggest reasons i do not wish to fly ive seen this horrible episode a number of times since it fist aired i cry everytime,negative
sad,negative
,negative
why would you hire somebody that barely speaks your language and you cant understand over a radio thats insane to me,negative
this was all human error fool also can realise if oxygen level is dropping it could be pressure problem simply a common sense due to one person carelessness n dumb brains many life are lost as im seeing this video im getting angry for that engineer n pilots hat up to young man how tried his best rip to oll people who lost their lives too sad,negative
a very brave young man trying his best,negative
its so sad,negative
how are we supposed to understand what is being said when theres languages talking at the same time,negative
therefore i see first of all the maintenance check did not set the switch back to auto when he was done and second the pilot speeded up the copilot when he was doing his switch check therefore the manual position was not noticed terrible loss of life for these reasons causing the crash,negative
the translator is same volume as the actor talking greek so it is very difficult to understand the translation,negative
i think andreas forced the plane down where he did as a way to save the people in athens i think he knew there was no way to land the plane hypoxia plus no fuel he did his best to save lives he knew he couldnt save the people on the plane rip andreas,negative
i feel bad,negative
nobody survive,negative
greetings from cyprus excellent rendition of this tragic incident,negative
why did andreas leave the cockpit to go and see his loved one and perhaps try and revive her or at least to say goodbye he had tried reviving the copilot but that was not working that is a very bleak situation,negative
why did the captain ignored the question about perssurization question about automanual ut was his fault too,negative
another humans mistake like always about airplan man eror can killed peoples,negative
just a simple passenger seat simulated oxygen mask dropping in the cockpit would have helped the pilot recognise the issue,negative
alarm sounds crew lets randomly push buttons and hope the alarm goes away is this how they are trained,negative
so sadrip,negative
who survived,negative
if there were four bottles of oxygen onboard lasting one hour each why didnt he put on the fourth one when the third one ran out if he went into the cockpit more than once he would have already known that the pilots have fainted why didnt he try to fly the plane earlier minutes is way too little time for oxygen the flight attendants need to react much sooner than twelve minutes if they got no response from the cockpit radio frequencies should switch automatically to the nearest control tower and not always only be controlled on board by pilots it should be part of training and procedure for all cabin crew to immediately inform the cockpit when oxygen masks drop in the cabin,negative
andrea was a brave man in the air disaster of helios flight he had to be still conscious on the plane to the end with his training as a scuba diver and the special forces plus helios flight protocols stated that their cabin attendants to not entirely depend on their flight crews in an air emergency like this one most of everyone had to be passed out from hypoxia but not andrea with his training as to why he was seen in the cockpit trying to radio for help only to run out of time to save the plane by then when it ran out of fuel after hours in the air when it was supposed to be a minute flight to athens rip to everyone who died on helios flight from an maintaience accident that led to the worst air tragedy in greek history,negative
there should be a way for ground engineers to connect directly to the planes conditions esp in emergency situations the plane shud send out the signal itself,negative
for helios airline my mom was about to go in helios airline but forgot the ticket my mum is lucky,negative
,negative
the sound on this video is absolutely terrible the narrator is only just heard above the music and the translator is barely heard over the guy speaking greek just a jumbled mess,negative
this is heart breaking especially to andreas who is still alive until the very end knowing you cant do anything at all to save everyone,negative
would the crew not notice they were getting groggy and feeling abnormal pressures,negative
why he left the cockpit he thought within sometime copilot will come back to his senses and will take over the flight so he didnt took the risk of handling the plane by himself he went to revive his girlfriend men in love can do anything but this man deserves the highest civilian award posthumously in the history of greece,negative
may all who died on this plane rest in eternal peace forever,negative
i read that the pilots also went through the checklist quickly because their flight was already delayed,negative
not a surprise all the planes dont get properly serviced unless its a million pound jet the rich get in,negative
pilots that are not speaking the same language sounds like a disaster on take off,negative
sound is so variable this is unlistenable at times,negative
aircraft design should not allow the aircraft to start or lock the brakes on till that air control system is in automatic position,negative
pressurization switch was on manual after pressurization test this is kept on auto normally,negative
engineer didnt reset switch pilot didnt check switch no cockpit indicator that masks have deployed,negative
can you confirm that the pressurization panel is set to auto a simple and proper response to this answer could save them all a series of bad luck and mistakes caused the crash it was a bad day rip,negative
rip all crews passengers captain n co pilot in the arms of the lordamen n amen,negative
andraos had oxygen from the bottles for a great deal of time why do you depict him as dizzy and sluggish,negative
was that engineer not punished,negative
then its the first time recorded history before this incident the o wasnt sufficient nor the masks design flaws,negative
i hate the cheap reenactment,negative
i usually never use this word but podromu was a true warrior the last man standing a spartan,negative
i hope they increased improved training procedures for the crew who changed the dial and didnt put it back,negative
the interview voice overs are awful on this video one cannot understand the translations,negative
oh my god my dad is going to love this channel,negative
who tf did the sound editing in this episode,negative
in these times of horrible tragedies on many parts of the world and the sheer sadness that those things bring to us it is really a bad time to add more heartbreak by watching this human beings arent supposed to be subjected this much overwhelming and unbearable abject heartbreak rest in peace all those who perished here,negative
very painful to see,negative
that all teach them to go back to the safest planes ever made dc,negative
the music in the background is unnecessary and real anoying i stopped the video after mins spoild what wold have been a good video,negative
,negative
a company with planes only that suits that many passengers they should know better and do better,negative
why is there a manual setting for this at all once the altimeter is over feet it should always be on automatic,negative
moral of the story dont fly cheap,negative
how can he talk without moving his teethis he human,negative
so painful and scarey plz check every before this aeroplane fly is painful how we loose love like this evetytime,negative
fly company are all afraid of plane grounded their dollar is more important than your life,negative
actor has a pimpedout wristwatch they didnt even bother to tighten,negative
its scary to know how many people had to die so flying could become safer and there are crashes even nowadays,negative
boeing your safety is our number concern,negative
this is the worst way to perish falling and knowing you are falling and feeling everything for multiple seconds,negative
question this is also an air crash investigation episode i can tell by the intro is mayday air disaster the same show like on disney or are they different shows with the same episodes,negative
this aircraft will be sold to orienthai airways after this flight,negative
what means modern plane in the history of flying since wright bros started at kitty hawk had its first flight in,negative
only god is saving planes in africa,negative
almost same case as japan airlines,negative
that aint how you use a rivet gun,negative
its crazy to me that so many crashes have been caused by temporary repairs and yet people still post videoa seeing mechanics duct tape parts of a plane ive never been on a plane but if i saw anything like that while sat on the plane id ask to immediately get off and request another flight and exspect it to be reimbursed too,negative
why always boeing,negative
repaired in china tskx,negative
so many crashes because airlines preform maitence as per the manufacturers instructions but really they cut corners for money,negative
man as impressive as it is seeing investigators track down how stuff like this happens it is gutwrenching finding out that the cause boils down to human recklessness regardless of the motivation be it time saving cost cutting etc it all boils down to negligence its impossible to ignore how much trust passengers are putting in the crew maintenance airlines and manufacturers to make it safe to fly such a catastrophic lost of life for what so a maintenance crew doesnt have to make the airline angry that they have to make a costly repair that they absolutely can afford to do,negative
the planes metal skin would be curled if it were a bomb proceeds to show debris from the plan with curled damage and say there was no evidence of that,negative
imagine being the one doing the repair job and caused the crash,negative
im afraid of flying but im hook on watching these kind of video lol,negative
dingo,negative
there must have been something wrong with the airplane am sorry for the people who died in this crashed,negative
to think an airline would risk their passengers like that to save some money on proper repairs makes me sick to my stomach,negative
i hope that everyone involved with jumbo jet upkeep and repairs are consistently checking over and under previous repairs before any new flights,negative
sorry for the poor souls,negative
,negative
the repair has no safety and quality base on standard manual repair,negative
what else u need to find from made in china lol,negative
those maintenance workers who did this poor repair job and wrote poor notes deserve prison time,negative
boeing has the disaster record of many air crashes and system failures why still this company is running how many lives are you guys will be taking sue them their licensed should be cancelled,negative
the news paper is from the air crash happened in,negative
china airlines used to have an air crash over death every four years which was called the fouryear curse by taiwanese people however after the flight crashed in china airlines carried out a large number of safety reforms and reorganizations and there has been no major air crash since then,negative
,negative
,negative
i am never flying taiwan ever ever ever,negative
profit above all that plane cant tak a break if its making that much money no breaks no inspections,negative
do malaysia airlines,negative
very bad maintenance and pilots something similar happened in san franciscoit was a chinese airline,negative
stop spreading your substandard products to the world so people will stop dying,negative
typical chinese quality,negative
weird that china have all chinese but america always has africans chinese vietnamese mexican etc shown in all our propaganda,negative
of course its a boeing plane,negative
out of durable material low quality object just by production made china plane are a life risk to all passenger who travel not safe at all its danger,negative
so similar to jal,negative
its a shame the same meticulous work that goes into investigating is not used to repair then monitor items on planes,negative
flying is gambling death,negative
a literal made in china moment lmao,negative
very well done episode,negative
another sad example of how the ccp destroyed china i will not buy ccp made products the history of failures with ccp control shows what is coming next the world is watching,negative
i thought it a bit unfair that the gentleman in charge of the investigation over there was saying that type of plane had a very bad reputation as though this was the problem only to find out that a poor landing some years earlier and very poor repair job by their own mechanics was actually the problem not to mention inadequate inspections how is any of that to do with the type of plane,negative
so they have so many check ups on cars or inspections so many times and on airplanes looks like they dont,negative
,negative
i dont really understand the patch layer impact to the frame structure,negative
as an ultrasound tech for structural steel inspection i will say no that technology cannot detect a flaw beneath another plate that sound energy would reflect back from the bottom surface of the repair patch it would have to be done on the surface of the original plate from either face a or face b,negative
profits over life when will the management ever learn this goes for anyone in management including me learn to use your brains people,negative
recommended not enforced ill sail,negative
i thought it was lighting,negative
coolest thumbnails most boring content ever id rather see d animated with a voice over than seeing people doing their boring ass jobs lol,negative
boeing what you expected,negative
turn background music more higher we cant hear music while you speaking,negative
is this is a joke flying billions of miles non stop will take years for a plane with its regular speed wtf lol,negative
stop using ai for your thumbnails,negative
its just like the show lost they are on an island somewhere thinking they are alive,negative
first mistake is patching something thats needs rebuilt such as sum that olds peoples lifes like come on lets be fr,negative

the dramatic reenactment of the hostess being pulled out of the plane was used too many times here to be considered tasteful come on seriously but this was a tragic event that someone out there knows that they are responsible for i hope they didnt suffer,negative
they say flying is the most safest transport in the world but when it goes bad it goes really really bad,negative
exhibit a criminal negligence astonishing how it still flew for years with a bleeding throat,negative
looks like oceanic airlines flight from lost,negative
bro the workers wanted to save time and material them wastes a whole jet,negative
that band aid patch held pretty good foe years,negative
this reminds me of jal flight where a similar incident involving tail strikes occurred,negative
they lied about the repairs,negative
this shows how you should do your job properly for the sake of the passengers what a good lesson,negative
ive seen nicotine stains on fingersbut on steel plates,negative
american asshole statement the moral of this story is the repair has to be done properly,negative
watch with adblockers or brave browser annoying ads every min,negative
i dont know much about planes but patches seems like a lot that plane should not have been flying,negative
may they rest in peace,negative
the voice of the narrator is amazing god has given him a wonderful voice,negative
the moral of the story china airlines corruption as per usual,negative
twa incident a cover up,negative
ca in,negative
weird why it is called china airlines and why china wanna shoot down a china airlines aeroplane,negative
and this is what happens when you let greed run rampant,negative
i would like to point out that the b had a center fuel tank which wing tags would cycle through during leveling of the aircraft its time to degenerates sparks from static generated by the fuel passing through the fuel lines within the tank the center tank bs exploded in midair before the cause was found since then anytime a b was flying with an empty center tank it was required to have to lb of dry ice dumped into the tank which would then displace any oxygen in the tank would be sealed an industrywide notice was sent in boeing who made the bs in conjunction with grumman was told to change the tank design and the transfer lines in a manner that could be filled refitted since those changes were made no bs with using empty center tanks for short flights exploded in midair it can be assumed from my point of view that the pilots decide to play it safe rather than risk and just directly pump to the engines from the wing tanks but the risk of sparking of any kind near the tanks was well understood and only an accountant would change designs to take such a risk to save or cents per wire not on like they did with the a warthog many times design flaws come not from the designers but from the accountants wanting to make a few extra cents per plane and yet there never held responsible for it,negative
cooked story from american brains i am sure they just put the blame on some maintaince work happend year ago flights before crash and so many times maintaince and inspection just blame someone middle class so that people cant be angry repairing,negative
saying daybree is crazy,negative
i would assume that the plane got crushed by the difference of pressure,negative
temporary repair or it must be permanent,negative
taiwan top airline of the worst airlines as well says a lot between china and taiwan unfortunately,negative
china airlines from taiwan wow not great,negative
,negative
so smoking on airlines could have saved a lot of passengers if people would not have banned it,negative
why does nobody talk about those mechanics who didnt make their work properly i mean they should know how important their job is in keeping airplanes in perfect condition in my opinion they should sue those mechanics who repaired those landing strikes in fact they didnt retain boeings conditions,negative
this acting is atrocious,negative
immediately jumping to twa is suspicious to me like there was no final conclusion as to what actually happened on that flight and by getting another that breaks up in midair gives the usa an excuse to investigate a separate crash to find evidence on the twa crash i truly believe that the us shot the plane down purposely and dont want to admit it and are doing all they can to find other evidence that cant be found or replicated on any other aircraft in history suspect you bet so when a plane breaks apart in midair and there is no fire no explosion unlike twa which there was a fire and explosion how does this compare it doesnt the first crash one should think about with breaking up in midair on a is jal in where a skid on the tail was poorly repaired and blew apart the back end of the aircraftjust like this,negative
all disasters are bad but there is something about a plane crash that seems to pierce the psyche with fear and terror and this particular disaster seems straight out of a horror movie,negative
so taiwans national airline is called china airlines and you westerners deny that it is part of china why would taiwan voluntarily call themselves this because it is the same reason they called themselves chinese taipei during the olympics let taiwan solve this issue with china and mind your own business usa we know how you helped ukraine then now threaten to leave them die say thanks wear a suit pay usa back for the weapons,negative
i heard about this story long time ago that this crash happened because of passengers smoking on a plane but never knew about the tail area being damaged,negative
i love how the guy is saying that the s were grounded but it only shows s,negative
i dont like the thought of somebody inspecting an airplane of any size wearing a suit and tie i mean theyre not gonna want to get their close dirty while they inspect it meaning theyre not gonna get into anything real requaring cause theyll get their suit dirtythats not what call an inspection in my books even when you inspect a caryoure gonna get durt and grease all over you if its done properly a man in a suit and tie cannot perform a proper inspection on any damn thing,negative
i think the plane put too much pressure on the inside of like blowing up a balloon way too much and it burst simple as thatit would only take one little weak spot and bang the whole body flys apart,negative
this incident was nothing like twa for starters there were no us navy missile ships within the vicinity,negative
airlines again cutting corners on maintenance happens all the time sad,negative
its crazy that the people who have to investigate theses crashes have to get on planes to go see the wreckage,negative
we all know now that it wasnt ukraine who shot down the malaysian airplane,negative
anyone here from brazil watching this dicumentary like t,negative
china skirting safety procedures and doing sub par work say it aint so,negative
need to find those incompetent lazy aircraft maintenance engineers that did this shoddy job years ago and put them in jail this is scary just thinking how many airplanes out there that have improper repairs and are just accidents waiting to happen,negative
side note i love how the airlines call sign dynasty subtly points out that theyre from the correct china that is the real heir to chinese history,negative
southwest airlines is the greyhound bus in the sky fly at your own risk,negative
ive missed that voice bro havent heard that voice in about years or so since the last time ive watched aci,negative

i was supposed to be on qantas flight in that overran the tarmac at hong kongs kai tak airport and ended up in the sea i was living in australia and i cant recall why my reservation was changed but i was on holiday in sha tin visiting with my parents when i saw it on the news not the november one this was around easter it was a daytime flight and it departed melbourne and crash landed in hong kong,negative
just watched the episode about twa had some crazy political pressure from the fbi that really undercut any actual fact from the ntsb glad this went relatively smoothly at least as its depicted,negative
my dad was on a business trip from taiwan to china bought this flight at the time my recent pass away grandma was in my moms dream telling her to change my dads flight so my dad delayed by a day took the other flight i remember my dad came home from china and showed me the ticket ci told me i almost did not have a dad anymore and his mom saved him,negative
hory shieeeeeetttttt,negative
reduce the background music please,negative
in case youre confused why china airlines is a taiwanese carrier its because officially taiwan is known as the republic of china or roc they roc are driven off the mainland and settled in taiwan with hopes that one day the mainland will belongs to the nationalist again,negative
greedy people will never learn since the beginning of the civil aviation decade after decade people were losing their lives due to some greedy mfers saving a few bucks,negative
quick fixes can be a killer,negative
i was young enough to see it happen on the news,negative
i thought air france was the scariest this one takes the cake,negative
dont watch this if you are nervous about flying today,negative
good luck checking for stress cracks on the new carbon fiber planes,negative
the rear of the plane broke off first,negative
why does this guy talk like his teeths are locked i cant unsee it now,negative
this is such a truly fascinating story the fact that this was a crash years in the making just gives me the chills the way that an entire aircraft can rip apart mid flight due to a repair done decades prior is simultaneously fascinating and terrifying it reminds me of the japanese cant remember the airline which also suffered a tail strike and was wrongly repaired leading to the tail being ripped off mid flight i also admired the amount of detail that went into this to even mention the nicotine stains seeping from behind the doubler plate what a terrifying and mind blowing case this is,negative
china plane rip,negative

the safest way to fly is in your dreams i havent been on a plane since my mid s im in my s now i watch these shows but thats it for me i wont be getting in planes no more and ive had dreams for many years about planes coming down and crashing near me and i have to run for it,negative

no one can beat samsung with respect to number of os upgrades and security updates it keeps the phone up to date and secured in fact i like motorola specs better than samsung m series phone which comes at that range but you quickly start to feel the phone is outdated with less number of version upgrades offered if moto matches the upgrade and update policy with samsung then with the kind of specs he has it will surely kill it for this sole reason i cant prefer moto and still prefer to go with samsung,neutral
uh so confusing launch motorola g power edge fusion everything is same key difference fusion comes with curved display g comes with flat extra fusion got wide angle camera fusion has g band n wont affect more just k more for curvedwide angleband n gb and the main thing fusion gives update where gpower gives update yea yea about the battery i know g has bigger battery like but still not small and with w is ok with with w and both screen time is around h that means both are totally optimized ig they could have launched the fusion starting with k with gb storage that wouldve better deal as year update is better than year aint it,neutral

how is its camera and network connectivity in comparison to motorola g knowing camera unit is little weak with low aperture but i dont it makes difference i think all cameras are same upto k,neutral

i am on the upgrade program so i am getting the iphone pro max regardless i think the camera functions if as rumored is not enough i want a bigger area for the auto focus to capture more pixels in the auto focusing system if you have a tiny focusing area there is nothing that is going to make the photo look good i would also like the iphone to stack multiple images and with ai as done in the pixel phone take the best part of all photos to make one great photo making it more like a dslr as in buttons etc i actually do not want and think apple is going in the wrong direction if i want a dslr camera i would get out and take my dslr camera with me i want ai to help me take better photos so they do not look as flat and lifeless as for the video mode dolby vision looks superb i look at a scene in the video mode looks great then i switch to the camera mode and the photo turn out flat and lifeless for close up photos like our dogs classic cars etc close up pictures look good its any photo feet away or further that look terrible washed outflat and lifeless i wish apple would fix that issue its like listening to music over a low bandwidth connection as for the current button on my iphone pro max i do find it hard to use not just the placement of the button but the swipe feature is hard to use i do like the ios and ipodos software,neutral
as much as i want the anti reflection display i have to stay unconvinced for now a company like apple that uses a stealth case to hide upcoming products would likely also use a privacy screen protector or cover as well,neutral
i took a shot every time you said actually im so wasted,neutral
does anyone get the feeling apple leaks things on purpose to gauge the reaction from the public as their focus group,neutral
orrrrrrrr its just a guy that put together a fake iphone with a d printer that includes all the leaks you guys think are coming just to screw with you all,neutral
oh man poor guy is definitely out of a job,neutral
dude thats a privacy screen not proof theres a anti reflective screen,neutral
mp with real up to x zoom camera would be to good to be true for this update what apple would implement next year hope apple is not going to replace x with just x it would be totally silly too long focal lens with even longer minimum focusing distance but apple is able to be that silly,neutral
did you trim that beard yourself,neutral
placing a button on a corner of a smartphone is just asking for it to get broken every one of us drops our phones at some point and the corners is what takes the first impact not very apple like,neutral
people say its so ugly but still always buys it but not me cross over from apple to samsung fold and i couldnt be more happy love this phone,neutral
i would hope the fixchange the camera control button place it lowerbetter ergonomically and make it less fiddly a simple two stage mechanical button would be preferable in my opinion like sony does with xperia line and use bigger sensorbrighter aperture for tele,neutral
no new color revealsyet tho,neutral
you are the best reviews among all really so informative as well as legit,neutral
a new lens system in a less robust aluminium chassisill be keeping a keen eye on the durability tests before i even consider upgrading,neutral
lol to those who actually believe its a leak and not a deliberate move by apple,neutral
im getting the iphone pro max,neutral
cool cant wait foe the new camera on the iphone fold,neutral
apple crazy button added samsung thinnest and largest zfold ever hmmm tim please leave,neutral
iphone,neutral
the best feature of the iphone is going to be that im finally done paying off my pro when it releases my kid uses my old pro and it still works beautifully for them iphone has reached good enough for of people a long time ago this is the stagnation in innovation apple needs to surmount,neutral
give me a bigger sensor i dont care about zoom improved sensors please,neutral
haha i dont buy this being an apple employee like they would risk trying it out in public and someone just happened to spot him,neutral
why is he acting like this is and the first iphone just leaked we already know that the new one will be of the old phone theres nothing new to invent everything comes down to software,neutral
well that guy got fired,neutral
but the black stick you said covering the apple logo is way higher than it should be making the whole thing,neutral
pffftt my pro looks so premium compared to this aluminium block,neutral
someone definitely lost his job,neutral
if its opaque its ugly ill never upgrade my pro until this design changes,neutral
no fold yet,neutral
watching this on my iphone,neutral
we do not need no more additional buttons,neutral
dont tell me what ill like its ugly,neutral
that apple employee is no longer an apple employee,neutral
ai feature camera feature button,neutral
i think i will upgrade to the new galaxy s next time iphones getting borring,neutral
fan foot of,neutral
modern marketing is lead by apple and its new name is staged leaks i dont buy such stories anymore,neutral
that apple guy is so fired,neutral
apple designs as of late are nonergonomic nonfunctional and nonelegance,neutral
theres no need for another button,neutral
new design is so your old cases wont work anymore f apple,neutral
for the past ten years every year has been all about the camera,neutral
if it will be all about the cameras then i will definitely skip this year too,neutral
using my p to simulate the idea of a camera button as shown here and it works quite well as a counterbalance for increased stability when half pressing the shutter down and focusing also if apple could let you tap same button to select and change the function of what you want to adjust like exp compensation zoom brightness focus etc with the slide function on the button already in the pro if that makes sense,neutral
if that x zoom is correct my hunch of a totally redesigned telephoto lens system that needed more interior space was correct it may be hiding a lense system that allows for x optical zoom without needing to go to the complex periscopelens system used by some samsung galaxy s models,neutral
special agents teach you how to dress quietly that man wanted to get caught to generate hype he was dual wielding iphones had a had and glasses on bro dressed like those people who announce they are moving in silence,neutral
,neutral
what i want with new iphone better zoom there zoom now are not good enough i need better and more video zoom,neutral
you do realize theyre doing this on purpose right this isnt just leaking out theyre doing it for attention free advertising to drive people crazy about buying the new iphone etc,neutral

update he is now a former apple employee,neutral
i dont think i would want the corner of my phone to have a cut out im not gonna use hoping thats not the case,neutral
hopefully the screen doesnt not get oil like s ultra,neutral
no one is taking photos horizontally these days everything is taken vertical for social media,neutral
ill only upgrade if the front camera has a higher mega pixel,neutral
apple bringing the scumbag zoom,neutral
look like apple will be firing another employee,neutral
dude is so stealth yet so vibrant ip is so stealth yet ring so pop,neutral
you need a haircut,neutral
well looks like at this point i wont be upgrading my iphone pro max as camera and vidio is good enough and if need more i grab my true full frame mega pixel camera when i stick a screensaver on i can choose between a reflective or nonreflective dark or light so its a mute point in my view,neutral
still gonna wobble becuase they just cant seem to make the camera rings flush with the housing,neutral
wtf with ya hair bruh,neutral
i cant be the only one who wants a better front camera,neutral
every year its only about upgrading the camera this is soooooo boring and ive been using an iphone since the gs,neutral
call me weird but i actually prefer the button on the screen even the dual function button on my full frame camera unless its on a tripod tends to induce a bit of camera movement when taking a shot the x zoom i like the sound of that may just tip me over the line to splurge on a shiny new phone,neutral
america st,neutral
than man just got fired lol,neutral
if its not a flip version then im not buying apple iphone are way too big,neutral
so before leaks said the promax was getting a x max zoom now its x interesting i wonder which rumor is true,neutral
an improvement to the lidar would be good for my use of it to survey buildings as an architect if it was as accurate up to metres as it is for metres that would be so much more useful,neutral

um where and when is this guy where hes out during the high sun day and wearing a long sleeve flannel and a puffy vest australia certainly not cupertino its an english speaking place theres also a palm tree behind him so if this is in california then these images were taken in december to march because thats the only time anyone would be dressed that warm out there i am highly suspicious of these confirmed photos,neutral
careful apple gonna sue,neutral
why do i have a feeling this is done intentionally like the guy wanted it to be seen,neutral
i still rather wait for the iphone fold,neutral
was leaked a by furry,neutral
youre gonna love it whether u like it or not,neutral
i dont understand why they would make the camera area even bigger i think its even uglier im ready for a change a not iphone change,neutral
should i upgrade my pro battery health with instagram stuttering scrolling to the pro max or wait for the pro max,neutral
im planning to upgrade from my pro to the pro max hopefully the price does not increase from the s last year,neutral
you think this guy loses his job after this,neutral
you know what else is massive,neutral
this camera control button is a such a useful feature that i have never used it in my pro max thank you for the reminder that it is there apple corp is such a pro selling people smth they dont actually need,neutral
theyve made the camera protruding even morewtf,neutral
someone is getting fired,neutral
so if i forget this one the bus i cant use my apps anymore,neutral
so you can say hes bricked rn,neutral
much more useful for like oh your kid needs to do homework well i will come and use this thing too remove the distractions from your phone or youre going to school let me remove the distractions from your phone while youre at school,neutral
not for breaking yourself unless youre breaking it and then leaving home so you can focus on the bus tour of the city or whatever,neutral

i am honestly failing to see how this is beneficial or maybe for kids so you can keep the brick can someone explain this to me like whats stopping me from just unbrickung when ever i want,neutral
people have no self control so how do we fix it make it harder with more steps,neutral

bro why did u spend money on this just set screen time on iphone and thats it,neutral
so whats stopping you from unbricking it or just deleting the app,neutral

i can think of different possible exploits as a result of this app,neutral
if you have the will power to install the app you dont need it in the first place,neutral
me using it to brick pornhub app,neutral

all shts and giggles until they bake it into bios,neutral
these products seem useless if you dont have the self control to not use your phone you will always find a way to bypass the limits you set on yourself,neutral
so literally screen time or focus mode but with more inconvenience this guys tech demos are getting worse,neutral
focus mode does the same,neutral

cant imagine you accidentally bricked a companys phone,neutral
nice but an addicted person wouldnt do that to himherself on purpose,neutral
tf would i stop my addiction to phone,neutral
i would just lay beside my fridge all day,neutral
they should lock it by the time not by tapping it again tho example if you tap the brick the app that includes to the gadget will be blocked for one day,neutral
so right now i am unbricked wait,neutral
i need this for me and my boyfriend,neutral
just uninstall the app,neutral

unbrick myself mrwhosetheboss,neutral
im almost certain you can just swipe up and close the app apple wont allow this type of invasive control of their os,neutral
yo bro,neutral

you can do this pretty easily with screen time settings fyi,neutral

dont worry my ipad isnt bent i just got carried away with an anamorphic lens for the aroll,neutral
he missed a big part of the why ipad os can only install app from the app store therefor i cant torrent locally or side load any app and a lot of the inapp plug in for videophoto editing doesnt exist for the ipad verson either up until this year you have no way to use whatsapp on an ipad either,neutral
google maps apple maps,neutral
no you cant replace regular desktop system with ipad my gosh grow up,neutral
well dang,neutral
nice,neutral
i believe with this update they just made the ipad into more of a surface not saying the surface is as good of a device just more in a way that you can use it eg as a student but if you need it as a real computer it wont do the job,neutral
ipad doesnt have that ugly notch,neutral
they really need to merge the macbook and ipad now its getting ridiculous just make the macbook have a touch screen once and for all and be done with this ipad getting closer and closer to a laptop,neutral
will music production softwares daws nd all work on it just as they do on macbook air,neutral
helping me get one step closer to purchasing an ipad,neutral
how many ipads did he drop in the making of this video,neutral
its a roadcar that you can use on the track and not a racecar that you can use on the road,neutral
i do agree with the media machine i use my mac to work and my ipad for shows and movies,neutral
having that on ipad and not on mac is wild,neutral
i replaced my laptop with an ipad pro and magic keyboard it does of what id like it to do i travel extensively for work and use the ipad in a regular case on the plane when i get to my destination i add the keyboard if i have any more serious work to do i have a mac mini at home the big benefit for me is the convenience of media consumption on the plane many of the streaming apps only allow downloads on a tablet i also have a company vpn which they wont let us use personal computers on but will allow tablets for some reason so for my use case as a traveling device i much prefer the ipad set up im already downloading this beta to check it out been loving the ios beta for the iphone,neutral
i cannot use one without the other it just makes my life easier and are more productive having both quick example i use the ipad for doing inspections viewing zone maps pdfs and other documents and i use the laptop for creating and editing pdfs working with excel and other software the ipad is very convenient to carry around on the job site the laptop still cannot be replaced by any tablet in this world period a good example is the microsoft surface tablets which run windows and still cannot replace a laptop is just a different world between a tablet and a laptop and so for my job i use the best the ipad has to offer me and the best from a laptop and i couldnt be happier and i did install ios developer beta long ago not the public one like in the video but still cannot replace my laptop just because you can move some windows around on the screen the functionality and the core operating system of the ipad and how it does things and doesnt is why i can say that with certainty some obvious simple things and options are still missing from ipad os i dont know why i wrote this much but english is my second language and i wanted to make sense thanks,neutral
but when its price equivalent to macbook always macbook will be superior choice over ipad,neutral
ipad is so powerful and the touchscreen is so helpful i do trading mostly using my ipad my macbook is only a sidekick,neutral
minimizing is useful with magic keyboard and mouse closing is faster with touch screen this is my take,neutral
signing that off file is easier on my s ultrawhy is that because iosipad os is hot garbage my windows tablet is still far more useful and cheaper what are we even doing here the ipad is a toy because apple wants it to be a toy,neutral
i enjoy the window management for the most part but some parts need some work before release sometimes i cant move a window and itll just constantly want to resize menu bar doesnt really do much yet and is finicky,neutral
dual boot on ipad is the simplest answer,neutral
apple will make sure that ipad and mac are different products ipad replace mac is not going to happen anytime soon,neutral
are adobe and figma works well on this new ipados,neutral
thing is though macbooks arent touch screen im in that position of deciding between an ipad pro and a macbook,neutral
so we wanted more mac features on ipad but now its heredo we want it,neutral
i miss the ipad physical round button,neutral
this is just laying the groundwork for when apple invents the touch screen laptop that everyone has had for the past years or so,neutral
is nobody gonna talk about how when you cmdtab and then cmdq it still doesnt close the app,neutral
still no terminal,neutral
if and when ipads can be my phone for calls and smss than ill buy an ipad again i rather have my all inone device to be an ipad rather than carrying my iphone and ipad yes i can leave my iphone at home with a wifi connection and get my calls and sms to my ipad but i dont want my ipad to be required,neutral
dang,neutral
please talk about the battle of visa mastercard and paypal telling us what we can or cant spend our money on,neutral
wait where do the files and media go if not download dont leave us hanging,neutral
howd you smash your thumb,neutral
dang,neutral
so youre saying an ipad is now the switch of laptops,neutral
you said that when you close an app it acts the same as the new minimize however youre not really closing the app that way the only way to fully close the app is to swipe up from the bottom to show all the apps and then to manually close it from there by hitting the x or by swiping up on the app,neutral
i could only call ipad a laptop when i could run xampp on it,neutral
it only took them years or whatever but it is good and about freaking time lol,neutral
whats so crazy is that this is the first version of this i wouldnt be surprised if at some point you cant tell the difference between your runofthemill ipad and macbook in use outside of all the touchscreen abilities,neutral
until it supports multi user its not relevant to my family,neutral
its almost as if apple always new an ipad would never replace a laptop for certain things,neutral
whats the best laptop for davinci resolve and adobe premier can ipad works and your recommendation for ipads as well,neutral

about a year ago i replaced my macbook air with an ipad and have loved it i travel internationally for work and i mostly use my ipad for sending messages taking notes watching videos and video conference calls most places i go have wireless casting so occasionally ill cast to a bigger screen for a different experience and sometimes when im in my home office ill connect my ipad to a large monitor and wireless keyboard and mouse but overall i love the look feel and ease of use of my ipad and will never go back to a traditional laptop,neutral
its minor but you can now play fortnite on the ipad at hz and as of now its not supported on the mac,neutral
what is this ios i have on my ipad am i missing something,neutral
is that a dent on your ipad danggg,neutral
no programming not a computer this has been a defining feature of computers since the term began to be used instead of calculator it needs to be more than just scripting thats a feature programmable calculators have it needs to not be limited to a subset of the devices capabilities,neutral
this whole video felt like a commercial for surface pro haha imagine if the tablet could be a computer now imagine it could game rog z apple has dominated the laptop thing they just need to sort out the ipad and also realize that not everyone needs both infact most people only need one if only we had laptop shaped shell for our iphones,neutral
how many times have we heard that ipads will be at last like laptops,neutral
insane that you cant have multiple audio playing at once on my phone i can go nuts n have every app all playing audio all being sent to different outputs even,neutral
you know it never clicked to open files on ipad and use markup app to sign then just upload and send always a pain with signing pdfs,neutral
what keyboard is that,neutral
well i think its now an obvious decision if youre on a budget and your work needs an ipad thing like digital art or so but you still need a computer an ipad air inch might be the best option my humble opinion great vid btw,neutral
mkbhd dang counter,neutral
we need macos on ipad stop skimping for music producers we need to be able to bring in our rd party plugins onto the ipad,neutral
why not just have both an ipad and a laptop,neutral
i just need full photoshop,neutral
how bad is this a going to slow down my m inch ipad keeping my ipad factory in the past year has kept the battery life up to par like its new i use it every day for art i made the mistake of downloading the latest ios for my iphone pro when i first got it last year that pos now gets hot as heck battery dies fast had it for a year and the battery health is at less than percent literally never getting another iphone again switching to samsung apple has been failing me and others for years now last good iphone was the xr that thing lasted me years,neutral
i have a mac studio but i dont have a laptop i do have an ipad so i guess thats the point right there,neutral
the mini can handle multi window but only ipad pros with mseries chips could handle stage manager holy shit,neutral
my mbp sits at my desk for heavy duty stuff but my ipad pro is main media consumptiontravel device,neutral

u really love daft punk like me,neutral
its not a computer and if you are a developer forget it i buy it every year and uupdate the ios to see if i can move to it but no and on top of that the macbook air with m is now the basic ipad pro inch plus keyboard is so i decided to get a macbook air and for real work i have a macbook pro m max gb more than enough,neutral
i have ipad air i update for ios betaits so laggy and buggy i dont really know if its only for me or its because a beta version,neutral
what movie is he watching mark,neutral
can the ipad os connect to more than one screen at a time now i was never able to have more than one screen extend the display of the ipad i have a dual monitor setup at work connected to my laptop i was trying to replace that with an ipad in the past since nearly everything i do is on m a dual screen setup extending the ipad display would be sweet,neutral

i really want to be able to connect to a large office printercopier to me thats the missing component,neutral
i prime example of people dont know what they want for years everyone has been asking for cursor support window supports etc only to realize they dont really want ipad to be like mac they want ipad to be more like ipad,neutral
just to be clear swiping up is not the gesture to close an app on ipados the gesture to close is a finger scrunch motion that would be why its the same behaviour as minimising i noticed that in this comparison you dont show the behaviour of the close button,neutral
can you resize floating keyboard on ipados,neutral
true talk and thats why i love your research video,neutral
can i code with vsc my c game thats for what i carry my macbook,neutral

i just want the blender god damn it,neutral
i just need visual studio code on the ipad,neutral

android was here in,neutral

random access memories one of the best albums from daft punk,neutral
whats that flappy bird game,neutral
yes its very good but in reality it lags and apps crash so we need to see the official release before we judge,neutral
the size of your weather widget is rediculous,neutral
apps on ipad is a good point for ipad i mean as an artist having procreate on your main machine where you too can then go to photoshop or illustrator stuff like that i think maybe is both thing becoming the same device is what would be great microsoft surface had it going for a while but i think apple can do a great work on that complex merge and ipad is really a stellar tablet at least when it comes to productivitie aside from media consumption,neutral
great summary also nice to see how all the new os stuff looks and works i have both and use both,neutral
innovation is when you lead your customers with new ideasstagnation is when your customers lead you,neutral
which is that flappy bird like game,neutral
actually i think i can change the spotify settings to be able to do the dual audio thing im pretty sure so check that out,neutral

i meanwe are never gonna run out of people bitching about the ipad trying to be a computer half of them are salty cuz theyve never owned one,neutral
personally after year with an ipad pro i have been trying hard to use the ipad to replace my laptop but it just cannot do it but during this time of trying to replace my laptop with it i have found ways to work with both of them either together or using each one for more specific tasks and the combo is kiler for what i do for work my question here now is if i should upgrade to a ipad pro or stay with the also i havevent been able to find a phone style case for the ipad something without a folio cover thats always attatched to it and that is not too thick thats a real bummer for me but hey its just a minor issue i have,neutral
it might be niche but i do really minor web dev to update my personal website and tinker around right now its just impossible to do on ipados even with the new update so im still stuck carying more than one device i just want one device that does it all i recently tried the new surface and its aslo so close but it has no native apps that lets you download videos so i still need to bring my ipad for videos on flights so im contantly stuck carrying two large devices,neutral
what popup keyboard case is he using,neutral
if you add a magic keyboard to the ipad arent you really not far off if at all from the size of a mac especially with how thin the macs have gotten it seems that it comes down to os preference as to if someone choose an ipad or mac for their computer since size isnt really a deciding factor,neutral
you really like brownies huh,neutral
uhh his hairline is slant,neutral
saving for upgrading my vanilla find x the little bro of the pro variant mk reviewed years ago because i want to try honor desktop mode on an old honor flagship foldable phone it has pclevel wps suite which other brands except huawei dont have then i can store files locally on my android phone and do office work anywhere anytime exclusively on a g device i can make calls with haha,neutral
please make a video about how to get out from ios to android and from android to ios how to get out from the ios net,neutral

they should find a way to run imac on ipad hardware,neutral
still no clipboard trash update,neutral
i feel like i shouldnt be this happy for something that should have been a feature for years now but i am so happy i forget about that i should not be this happy,neutral
no it is not and it will never will be we all know this deep down why do we pretend apple is eventually gonna make ipad into a mac at all anymore,neutral
so for you the computer experience is just about window management where is my terminal homebrew cli tools docker python and npmfor gods sake what about the ability to install any app or package i want what about spotlight or alfred browser extensions vms i cant believe a major tech youtuber claims that the ipad can replace a real computer just because it now has a better window management system,neutral
the ipad is definitely one of those devices that noone is really needing but everyone would be happy to have one,neutral
minutes to explain why someone should buy a device is definitely a reason why you dont need that kind of product in your life,neutral
still sucks in using google sheets,neutral
my ipad is for streaming download while on a flight or traveling extended screen for my work mac especially when am traveling and signing stuff and doing brain writing using the pencil these cannot be done with a macbook and so for me its a huge plus i have the best flex device for travel and on top of that casual browsing at home so i shifted from a macbook pro to a mac mini for large monitor use at home and the ipad as the companion devicethe ipad os is a great improvement to do more of the above,neutral
for me its better a macbook air you can do everything,neutral
would there ever be a surface vs ipad video,neutral

didnt mention the thing i think is most important ios is a locked down os you can only install apps that apple approves from their store macos on the other hand is still open in the sense you can download any rd party program on the web and install it without apple knowing about it,neutral
i love what they did with this update from the perspective of how easy it now is to do multitasking if i want to,neutral
the windows and their management support is very good however the ipad cannot really replicate the apps the way they work on a computer which is the key difference between a mac and an ipad overall good update tho,neutral
super heavy super ugly turn my ipad to a turtle with screen,neutral
if apple would just pull a nintendo switch and hybrid these devices it would dominate using a surface with touch capabilities then a macbook is disappointing they could easily do a hybrid os that switched when docked into a keyboard,neutral

that is not the periscope camera of its the main lens periscope is the top camera that is not aligned with the others although i didnt like phone this is misinformation or he doesnt know,neutral
i still dont know why the nothing ceo still thinks high about their phones and compare it to other better flagship phones also why they are doing some kind collaboration with other youtubers for the dream phone they wanted idk but considering this all as awkward due to their overpriced new phone which cant even stand upto kk price range phones,neutral
welcome to india our own manufactured products have high tax so that people can buy cheaper china made phones,neutral
if this continues nothing will remain nothing,neutral
get the oneplus gb for this price,neutral
i agree with all of them except things us pricing is before taxes although its higher even then its something to note just because a feature is available in lower price phone that doesnt make it not flagship feature its difference in how it works on higher end phones makes it a flagship feature,neutral
probably because if you look up literally anything about nothing or if you looked up anything over the past two years between the phone and release dates literally all you ever saw was indian articles and videos of crap fake news you literally have ti make your search and add a india to find real articles the country appears upsessed and they will make the sales there regardless,neutral

this is the razr,neutral
i would buy one if it didnt have an external screen,neutral
i get my on tuesday cant wait,neutral
where in kl do they sell this,neutral
mine is on its way,neutral
i changed samsung for motorola after years and had both samsung flip and and i bought the motorola razr ultra well its a bit of a difficult phone but designed way better than samsung i mean a trillion time but samsung still beat it,neutral
i need tips im new to flip phone i have mixed feelings but only been a day,neutral
i want it but the rio red version is still not available in the uk and motorola customer service is not as good as it once was,neutral
motorola needs to make improvements to their os make it similar to iosone ui hyper os magic os or oxygen os etc,neutral
the fact it even needs a screen before you open it shows how much of a failed concept these flip phones are,neutral
i have a razr and mine has the cover screen mine is the razr ultra,neutral
wait till the samsung new flip come out in a few months the razr price should drop,neutral
thats a reason i use still because the small screen wont distract me,neutral
just such a cool form factor,neutral
huh the ultra from has the same size outer display with the exact same functionality i have one its great,neutral
maybe we should bring back small phones,neutral
im still using my pre order,neutral
i understand the urge to flip the phone open but i would suggest not doing it its very hard on the phone not to mention it wasnt designed to be abused,neutral
if you have last years model dont give in to the consumerism keep it get your moneys worth,neutral
also a good hack is downloading the google camera and the photos will get much better so of course is over samsung a great deal,neutral
still using the i just love it,neutral
its buyers are fuel station registered typists st that advances complicated legally actionable tool related disabilities to each new buyer it engages from a diagnostic position drawn on a board in a hidden location id say its not fitting for each registered buyer handler as is sold to every walk in it is multiple side projects hung on an old rand mcnally map with a station legend recall it needs a traditional filing cabinet style available from screen as an option to this style which is an unsorted sock box style,neutral
whyre you opening the phone like that its so harsh,neutral
i have the sulta tb i love the video and photos i can take with it would it be worth replacing my phone with the tb motorola razr ultra,neutral
just bought the almost days ago i love it,neutral
iam broke nigga,neutral
love it better than samsung,neutral
the small front screen is proof people want smaller phones not bigger phones,neutral
i want that phone,neutral
i had the less than a year before it broke i see what motorola tried to do but they missed with that one i might try the version i might,neutral
i have the moto razr,neutral
i have the razr and will definitely be buying the as well motorola ftw,neutral
hes wrong it will break and you will regret it he doesnt know what he is talking about,neutral
can you slam shut it aggressively and will it hold up thats the only reason why i wanna get it,neutral
what is the difference between the razr and the razr,neutral
with this clicks keyboard this is a killer device but i need a more rugged phone and imessage so,neutral
can you do a camera review of the regular razr even a short one would be great thanks,neutral
ya upgrade to a but if you have a razr like me wait,neutral
i have the regular razr and its awesome does all the same stuff as this one so i dont feel the need to upgrade plus i just got it like two months ago from boost for lol,neutral
does the front screen of any clamshell phone allow for responding to mfa prompts all day without needing to open the phone thats what is letting me down with my flip it has to be open of the time to get any work done is this a solution or will i be forced to return to a slab phone right now a flipable is a useless party trick,neutral
if u long press on that bar on the bottom u can make instagram and such full screen on the outer screen,neutral
how about compare it with samsung flip,neutral
what does the phone feel like,neutral
please make us smartphone with real keyboard its so intuitive and easy for me,neutral
flip phone i wish i can use one not to talk of you saying one is old,neutral
what are the downsides though with using a foldable,neutral
theyre literally catching on fire,neutral
hey just a reminder that this short is sponsored by dji but i want to be super open with what this means they get to advise on the topics i talk about not what i say about those topics though they get to see and approve the script before we film but it also works the other way around we reject about of sponsored video requests because i only want to do a sponsored video on products that i genuinely think are awesome so we ask for the product to be sent out to us before agreeing to make the short we test it to make sure we love it first we cancel partnerships with any brand that tries to interfere with my honest opinion hope this helps,neutral

i had my neo drone four months it got basically cancer electronic issues there was places in the park where it would fly no lower than three feet when i went under the place yet it was two and a half feet tall the drone always rises to the top and gets stuck there all by itself many times i will lose complete control of the drone i did learn how to fly manual on the drone i got the controller three and the goggles in three and despite everything that i said bad it was it was a blast owning this drone i paid for year warranty no they say i will get it back in three months if i use my care refresh because of the band they cant tell me a new drone but they say they can mail me back my drone after repairing it you would think they would promptly return my to your carerefresh money my advice if you can find one of these by two or threethey do take calls and they help you with any technical issues,neutral

whats the apps name,neutral
i want to control it with my smart watch,neutral
hi how accurate is the tracking and how fast is it if i wanted to take it skiing would that work,neutral
some things to keep in mind before buying a neo if you wanted to make vlogs or any other profit making content as discribed in the video youll need a faa part licence which will cost you about the same as the drone itself roughly legally in the usa and many other places the remote pilot in command must be able to stop any automated flight modes immediately that means flying without a controller which is the main appeal of the neo is illegal the neo lacks collision avoidance sensors it has some kind of ai system using the camera but ive seen plenty of videos of that fail and obvious that only works flying forward there is a known issue while flying with no controller where the gps gets confused and causes the drone to fly off into the sunset uncommanded and as far as i can tell completely randomly my advice for getting into drones would be to skip the neo and go for a mini or mini k depending on your budget as well as a part also please learn the laws about drones the community is getting a bad enough reputation due to ukraine and chinese combat drones as well as people being assholes with them the last thing we need is more excuses for lawmakers to overregulate drones more than they have done already,neutral

can you give me this one,neutral
i am getting a samsung s plus in black,neutral

i dont know why but till s ultra their phones are almost killer cuz of his cylindrical straight bit circle look with no round sharp edges i mean thats a real flagship but now in s series they have done same thing as others are doing like round edges straight frame rather than unique cool cylindrical sides,neutral

hahahaha copying apple,neutral
can it resist a hammer tho i might test that out lol,neutral
wow so different i almost fell from the edge of the flat earth while listening to you outlining all these differences,neutral
brother the samsung watch or watch ultra can do the same or even more,neutral
how much info does it steal in the process,neutral
sick,neutral
having the sensor on the side is a very underrated feature i feel like samsung would include that but then no one would by their rings,neutral
for most people heeee,neutral
and the esr rebound keyboard,neutral
can you make a video a bout ipad air m,neutral
i l watchng your channel,neutral
first sapphire screen and titanium body are common,neutral
note that saphire is not meant to be shatterresisant but scratch resistant so do not smash your watch it breaks easier than normal glass,neutral
samsung has the double tap feature and the sensor lol,neutral
it would be great to have a video of this smartwatch compared to the galaxy watch and apple watch,neutral
galaxy watch have some of them gestures,neutral
affordable and durable,neutral
,neutral
his hai,neutral
do you know what has the the first features the watch ultra and,neutral
,neutral
apple watches have all of these features lol,neutral
i have that double tap thing in my samsung watch i think its the first samsung watch,neutral
the best company so far,neutral
just stating the specs of the watch is useless id rather check with the quantified scientist for a data based verdict,neutral
does it sync well with iphones,neutral
ah yes i thought the ice was going to break the watch,neutral
all copied from galaxy,neutral
huawei has an insane eco system as well,neutral
i love huawei innovations,neutral
lol sapphire is more brittle than normal glass,neutral
im watching you from bangladesh,neutral
bro make a big vid on huawei that should give a big impact to other big lazy brands your voice is big,neutral
you forgot to mention the best feature sending all your data to the ccp,neutral
bro samsung already had this from like,neutral
i have all of that with the galaxy watch pro,neutral
i had to upgrade from my huawei mate to s last year because of missing playstore in huawei phones otherwise the software and hardware package of huawei is the best imo,neutral
and it stalks you and your family,neutral
because made in china,neutral
these are all samsung features already and have been since the galaxy watch,neutral
lets talk about battery and of these fancy watches will cry in corner aint buying these craps anymore,neutral
dont abuse that watch,neutral
i have all of those features except the ecg that the watch has on my galaxy watch from years ago,neutral
lol the galaxy watch too,neutral
my teacher has a huawei watch and my schoolmate,neutral
apple watch can do this too,neutral
it also listens to what you say and send it to the ccp,neutral
no matter what i will always respect huawei and honor both are really great chinese brands in a good way,neutral
budget watch from huawei,neutral
bro just described an apple watch,neutral
loved it,neutral
watch classic did those all years ago,neutral
i wanna buy it,neutral
i have the garmin fenix solar salphire and its also uses titanium and that watch costed a leg,neutral
any apple watch will do all of these things crazy what does to youtubers,neutral
they shouldve called it the huatch,neutral
i have that watch lols,neutral
these features were introduced in apple watch years ago same hart rate sensor was introduced like years ago yep apple is scared that chinese companies will steal the technology,neutral
does it have blood pressure monitor and also can it work well with non huawei fones battery life why do you focus on things that dont matter,neutral
dumb sapphire is more brittle it is extremely scratch resistant but it can shatter much more easily than alternatives if you smash it against things,neutral
the thumbnail for this video is just his hand crazy i knew instantly who i was about to watch,neutral
this one sends your data to the ccp rather than to the nsa thats the main difference,neutral
samsung does the same,neutral
i just dont like the way it looks im sorry,neutral
this guy is a walking ad like that black mirror episode,neutral
thats not how sapphire glass works its harder than glass so more scratch resistant but because of that its not as elastic as glass so its more brittle doubt ice could scratch glass or sapphire but when hitting it like that glass would survive more times than sapphire,neutral
forgot to mention the neurotoxin injector that activates when taiwan,neutral
the apple watch ultra literally has all of these features,neutral
as if apple doesnt already have the tapping feature,neutral
does it also avoid giving you skin cancer,neutral
it can also sell your soul to the chinese government,neutral
as long as you are fine with the ccp having all your personal info go for it,neutral
apple watch from temu,neutral
are there so much chinese viewers,neutral
tipe apa pro atau biasa,neutral

thats a nice design both soft wand hard,neutral
found it better than my samsung watch infact look like dos and windows comparison,neutral
the whole video is a sponsor nothing but a sponsor,neutral
what color is that,neutral
not to underplay huawei but my galaxy watch is pretty much the same aluminum body not titanium but has sapphire screen gesture navigation and ecg body composition with side buttons,neutral
hi apple user here its fair to say we wont get this feature until and when we do get it apple will be acting like the world has never seen it before,neutral
what will it do when i wave at you,neutral
aaaand the heartrate monitor sucks is way way worse than my old fitbit,neutral
bro everyone saying huawei is innovative when apple did the gesture thing first,neutral
samsung coppt,neutral
ill never forgive america for stopping hauwei using using google playstore instead of forcing their own companies to improve they had to nuke the competitors,neutral
arun are u tamilan,neutral
the best samsung galaxy watch blood pressure is not working,neutral
samsung has gestures for fe and more same as samsung for reading health app the bpm and blood presure ect ect,neutral

i will never touch a huawei device because of the fact they work with the ccp,neutral
hell keep using apple watch anyway,neutral
nice i just have to wait years so apple does this too,neutral
everything that he said is on an apple watch already,neutral
apple watch samsung watch has it too huawei copying,neutral
also what is said in front of the watch will be delivered to the ccp enjoy,neutral
so like an apple watch,neutral
yes apple needs to copy all of this,neutral
everything you just mentioned i can do on my apple watch and more,neutral

samsung did is first,neutral
love that watch,neutral
arun is this your primary watch or is it apple watch,neutral
the accurate sensors and gesture control have been on the galaxy watch since god knows when kudos for huawei for staying in the game,neutral
huawei and china are the future,neutral
in my opinion they have a very ugly design,neutral
i thought sony samung and xiaomi were the greatest ever tech companiesbut no theres huawei,neutral
but does it work with androidother devices,neutral
nice watch,neutral
so we aint gonna talk abt his super white nails,neutral
i love the design its unique and doesnt look like an i watch,neutral
congratulations you received social credit,neutral
hey look its the thing that apple watches have had for years,neutral
this is why orange man banned huawei because us companies couldnt keep up,neutral
be careful sapphire is not so much shatter resistant but is mostly scratch resistant,neutral
finger gesture is also on samsung watches not a unique thing tbh so ok i guess the side sensor is the only noveltie it seems to me,neutral
i have huawei watch fit i would say its bit expensive in my country but yeah its good fit band and i loved it the amoled display is superb better than those cheap brand smartwatchs gimmick,neutral

maxx ive been watching you since hs and dont remember you ever spending money its okay to enjoy it and id argue you should more,neutral
apple should bring out colourful inch or so apple display for this mini and make it k resolution for so the studio display ventures for the mac studio and mac pro,neutral
any other mini pc apple mshit mini m,neutral
can you connect the mac mini to a k tv like a sony or panasonic instead of an apple monitor,neutral
they need to put an ultra chip in this,neutral
i hear a lot of people saying its got all these ports all maybe im missing something possibly more ports,neutral
so can you play apex legends or fortnite on the mac mini,neutral
could i find a mac mini m pro for example refurbished same price and have better use for it more ram hd when working with design layers on top of layers mostly pixel work it is my job so i need to get the most computer power i can get thank you,neutral
but wheres the gpu,neutral
if i wasnt dependent on microsoft office products for my work id definitely get a mac mini,neutral
size means nothing it just sits there what does matter is it blows every intell or amd in its class right out of the water,neutral
what is it good for there are tablets with snapdragon elite and native arm software,neutral
but can i game though,neutral
a computer without ecc cannot be trusted,neutral
and if you want gb ram its only an extra,neutral

why does he have headphones,neutral
apple rip you off thou if you want to add some upgrades to you mac mini,neutral
if price is a problem ive seen base m minis for in a couple of stores micro center and best buyi expect most everyone will need a hubstand like satechis which can also have a tb ssd internally talk about a fast external to the mini ssd,neutral
it sucks you cannot play games unless apple allows it it gets hot after hours of actual use what is good for as an over priced chromebook,neutral
isnt x square,neutral
double your money and double your storage increase its performance by increase the ra by works well now but tomorrow and grab a few thunderbolt ports even gigabit ethernet all of which cannot be added yet will most certainly extend the minis longevity as a legitimate computer that doesnt bog down your ability to work that said other than gb it is a beast that changes the ability to get a killer computer at a reasonable price thats gonna last a while assuming youre not cutting video or folding dna building llms locally or running vms call me greedy but i know we got gb ram but apple couldve still hit the same price point with s in there wouldve made it perfect but the size of files from even thr iphone in still or motion are large not everyone is as savvy as u n i setting an external ssd for libraries and other large files that play well with their host software on the main drive just makes it easier to have the storage you need on board and honestly a tb is more like s necessary storage amount if buying new and hoping to use for a few years ive got a flight simulator taking over gb of data on my xbox logics audio supplements are gb easily kept on external i know but its just so darn easy to not have to remember the external because of the room internally and it sucks apple continues to put the customer in such an egregious corner with both ram ssd storage price gouging which is exactly what it is not even xbox or playstation storage modules are that brave especially when anyone can walk into beat buy and pick up tb nvme drives for what theyre charging be cool if someone came up with a better way than unsoldering the chips and reinstalling larger modules it is what it is and the same is happening ok the other sidebut theyre paying for gpus watt psus and shoddy cpus or screaming cpus that drink electricity no change in form factor and liquid cooling necessary to keep em running its cool consoles exist lol,neutral
can it play minecraft,neutral
on amazon thats insane,neutral
and in true apple fasion you have options option throw out all your old peripherals for new usb c ones option use a boat load of adapters apple is trueley visionary in there ability to make you spend extra money you dont need to,neutral
howbownahbro,neutral
mac studio got a m max now,neutral
i got the late mac mini and i love it it does everything i need to do and it has regular usb on it which is awesome and i can mount it to the back of my computer screen and its got windows x lite so its very fast,neutral
i would love a full size mac pro with the specs and pricing of mac mini but filled with ports who cares about a small desktop anyway we need ports,neutral
if only the m macbook air was just as affordable,neutral
ive been thinking about buying the m pro macbook pro when it comes out but the mac mini just convinced me not to because for that price i could get a macbook air this year and for the total combined cost of another macbook air a few years down the line totaling basically buying a macbook air every years is financially a better decision than buying a macbook pro every years thats just my opinion cause you think omg this new chip is so good then years later the base model has a cheaper more efficient chip thats also cheaper to buy into,neutral
so mac mini is and iphone e is damn,neutral
also wtf only monitors,neutral
micro center has the base at,neutral
gb storage for and you void your warranty if you upgrade it manually instead of paying extra for more lmao,neutral
it just keeps getting smaller,neutral
x rectangle,neutral
these computers would be really fast in a school zone the students could use the upgrades from chromebooks lol,neutral
i love watching shorts about great tech with a video thats about frames per second,neutral
the only reason they double the memory was so that they could put apple intelligence on it but for years they were selling you full priced goods with under developed tech,neutral
one problem its still a shite apple pc,neutral
x is not a rectangle,neutral
its basically an iphone in a bigger box than a phone without the phoning parts,neutral
crazy thing gb storage it is a joke,neutral
ive seen smaller things,neutral
back to i can comment with pictures there,neutral
gb is useless,neutral
its definitely a go ahead for many including myself but i will be getting the max gb ram but the ssd i will upgrade it privately,neutral

someone must have jumped from intel nuc team to apple its identical,neutral
dear mkhbhdstrjfg please swear on your mothers life that the costvof thet conputervis dolars and ninety nine cents as you say,neutral
they upd it to gb but of you get for half the price put them together you get the se reaults actual save a whole dollar,neutral
he thinks its shaped like a rectangle lol,neutral
its crazy that just a couple of months ago i bought an upgraded mac studio and now this new mac mini comes along that can compete with my current mac studio i could have saved by getting the higherend mac mini instead,neutral
why is it not usb c powered,neutral
hard drive,neutral
my favourite part was when that guy started talking over marques thats how you know that guy is a hack,neutral
why notthe people will marvel complain and rejoice,neutral
still gaming is shit and as long as gaming is shit the wont sell in big numbers,neutral

mac always compares itself to macespecially on the desktop for a reason and it isnt a good reason its marketing bs,neutral
can you game on it,neutral
what do people do on mac,neutral
its not a good deal bc it only has gb ram its useless for anything really lol,neutral
i need this for pro tools,neutral
commercial,neutral
mac dick riders are so funny to me they prop up a company that overcharges for everything and that constantly fights against stuff like right to repair its honestly not surprising that a guy like this would go mph in a school zone since he clearly doesnt care about the average person if hes recommending apple products,neutral
gb is basically useless these days,neutral
i miss the part why should i buy,neutral
and cooling,neutral
just returned the m pro not powerful enough for advanced task in,neutral

im thinking of trading in my macbook air for this,neutral
has he not seen nucs or pretty much any minipc the mac mini could have been this size years ago so it being smaller isnt all the impressive other than that it is a quite nice desktop computer,neutral
i see no reason to buy it,neutral
they made it smaller because everyone else was making tiny pcs dunking on the mac mini that wasnt so mini for s,neutral
yeah too bad its a mac,neutral
does it make a popcorn,neutral
first of all how could a inch by inch can be a rectangle,neutral
its not beating the m or m ultras stop lying,neutral

can it do cuda things,neutral
i dont trust mister wallpaper man at all poser,neutral
but can it run crysis,neutral
wow what a great use of time so glad tech negro is here to tell us the size price and options you can all see on the website this guy is really smart,neutral
i did see a reddit the other day that an end user was getting throttling lag in their m pro setup which could be mitigated by manually running the fan not sure if this is isolated but they went to ultra m would not have been my choice tbh and no issues,neutral
need context it is fast for a minipc with igpu,neutral
idk i need a computer that can run games and im poor so no apple for me dont like it xd,neutral
this guy suckjsjust expensive cam no personality,neutral
you do smart,neutral
the biggest shill this guy is,neutral
apple understands that we used to be able to afford apartments larger than a phone booth but now x inches is a significant percentage of our highrent living space thats actually larger than my share of the bed when you consider it must be shared with roommates,neutral
its super fast but you cant do anything on it nice job apple let me install linux on it and you can have my money,neutral
where is the power button,neutral
is the roll of duct tape included,neutral
can you run windows on it,neutral
what the best screen you would recommend for it,neutral
at costco do you know of any list of which monitors work with the mac mini as the apple scaling can be an issue fonts wise i want large enough yet crisp and well rounded fonts like the imac will render,neutral
ehy is it a thing to say it is small if it is not a laptop its for a deak who the fck give a shit how big or small it is m,neutral
wish we could game on it,neutral
the ssd upgrade to tb is a thousand dollars no mate,neutral
marques is a sellout for apple we already know that,neutral

in a adds a lot to any video,neutral
add one step up in ram and ssd and you have paid double the price of the base m mini apple is a drug dealer the first one is cheap you want more pay up,neutral
if its inch by inch its square not a rectangular thing,neutral

according to a report by the bbc in london a modern italian is the sum of romans these do not exceed germanics including lombards ostrogoths visigoths heruli vandals suevi and normans all of the above germanic accentuated in what is now italy and to a lesser extent celts and greeks separately there is sicily which belonged to carthage today tunisia and part of turkey invaded by the romans and when it dissipated it was taken by the arabs although it was ephemeral due to ostrogothic pressure and in the end the normans prevailed over that territory from the above it could be said that a modern italian is a mixture of western europe,neutral

this video is absolutely stunning and the way you capture the beauty of italy is truly inspiring however i think theres a little too much focus on the tourist spots while theyre amazing it would be even better to see some hidden gems that locals love just my two cents,neutral

you got poppy playtime nah but i got the history of playtime co poppy playtimes elliot ludwig founded playtime co in the same year that his marriage fell apart resulting in divorce its fair to say that his dedication to his work and workaholic lifestyle contributed to his wife leaving him however the loss of his love didnt deter ludwig from achieving his dream of bringing joy to children he worked tirelessly to create a line of toys that children love in fact he went the extra mile with the launch of playcare an onsite orphanage ludwig believed that all children should feel love and comfort while this appears to be a humanitarian mission we all know it has unfathomable consequences for children and employees alike still this seemed to be a great venture for a while at least until the death of a family member in though we have no concrete evidence of this a popular conclusion is that its his daughter a loss of that magnitude certainly explains the drastic actions he takes further down the line this could well be the catalyst for what we all know is to come during poppy playtime chapter theres an untitled red tape thats very easy to miss this tape sees poppy discussing the aftermath of the hour of joy and reveals herself to be elliot ludwigs daughter explaining that things were better when he was in charge while the details are still foggy this leads us to believe that poppy was sick or died at a relatively young age and playtime cos experiments began as a means of bringing her and other sick children back in the bodies of toys this is supported by other tapes found throughout the chapter where employees reflect on some of the awful things theyve seen inside the factory justifying it because of the great work and results that may come of it if the experiments continue unfortunately it looks like these experiments got out of hand over time potentially when ludwig was no longer in control resulting in far more torture pain suffering and death than good the experiments the pure intentions of ludwigs company and its playcare orphanage turned to dust with the loss of his loved one for this is when the abhorrent experiments begin ludwig wanted to put people into the toys and that led to some disastrous results however before we dive into the horrors we need to point out that some experiments are consensual not that this makes up for the way playtime co tries to play god in a couple of cases we actually know the people behind the toy and we think were likely to uncover more of them in later chapters thomas clarke thomas clarke is a rare example of a consenting experiment in he signed up to be a subject when hes diagnosed with lung cancer and this resulted in him becoming poppy playtimes bron marie payne this is a heartbreaking story as a kind and caring woman went through unceremonious torture and experimentation that ultimately turned her into poppy playtimes mommy long legs as well discuss in the chapter section she harbors a lot of anger resentment and hostility making her an incredibly dangerous individual to the playtime co staff however as her transfer request indicates shes not always been this way in fact she was known to be a very motherly being loving and looking after the children in the game station a little extra tidbit is that her last name payne sounds exactly like pain i wonder if this is an unfortunate coincidence or a foreboding omen of whats to become of her makayla hyssop makayla hyssop was a test subject who turned into a poppy playtime candy cat toy unfortunately playcare had essentially become a breeding ground for experimentation by this point here the children were required to complete three different tests not that theyre aware thats what theyre doing through these tests playtime co employees could determine how successful an experiment may be theodore grambell an orphan of playcare theodore is the child who goes on to become catnap he had an imaginary friend that caused some concern with the staff which is unsurprising given it turns out his pal was the prototype experiment led the child into all sorts of trouble and to put a stop to his rebellious nature the staff made him part of the bigger bodies initiative as catnap theodore was in charge of putting the children to sleep in playcare preventing their escape and even kidnapping them as the staff commanded quinn navidson another orphan of playcare quinn navidson was a troubled and shy child who frequently ripped the heads off toys and switched them out for other toys heads due to a desire to make them prettier this behavior even spilled over into his trials at the game station where he was noted as having bitten the heads off some of the whackawuggy plushies dr harley sawyer took a special interest in navidson believing that the child held himself back so that others would have lower expectations of him sawyer convinced navidson that he could see the real version of him encouraging him to try harder at the tests which resulted in much better scores following this in sawyer chose navidson to become experiment the bigger bodies experiment title for poppy playtimes yarnaby documents originally describe yarnaby as docile agile and highly impressionable surprisingly not showing the signs of hostility that other experiments displayed towards scientists and staff sawyer saw this as an opportunity deciding to isolate him and manipulate him into becoming his personal bodyguard following sawyers removal yarnaby lapsed into an unresponsive state longing for his master to return however in chapter we see that yarnaby got his wish serving under the new version of the doctor and behaving in a far more hostile manner at his command riley riley was an orphan who entered the playcare in august at age following the death of her parents riley initially felt like an outsider due to most of the other children having arrived at the orphanage at a much earlier age noting her feelings and memories in a journal that you can find scattered throughout chapter in her diary she recounts the process of trying to fit in then her feelings upon being chosen by dr white initially believing that it meant shed been adopted by a couple however her later entries reveal that she was instead transported to the prison beneath the factory and given a shot after which her skin opened up like flower petals and she saw a man who looked like a doctor digging around inside me taking thigs out after this she found that everything hurt and her body wasnt hers any more implying that shed been turned into an experiment during and after the hour of joy riley hid inside her cell and refused to eat bodies like the other survivors she later noted that the train is the main method of transport in and out of the prison deciding to take the key from the dead conductor to make sure no one else can come here hoping that she can at least save just one person as the protagonist you find the key with rileys corpse in chapter her body appears to be a skeleton with pink fur and a tattered blue ribbon around her neck suggesting that she was a failed first attempt at making a bigger bodies variant of poppy playtimes kissy missy this is supported by the huggy wuggy we know being noted as experiment and the kissy missy we work alongside having the name of experiment suggesting that there was another experiment between the two and leading us to believe that riley was in fact experiment,neutral
